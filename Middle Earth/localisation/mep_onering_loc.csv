EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.0;You find yourself in possession of marvelous golden ring, seemingly as if it chose you. As days pass, you find it difficult to be with it and begin to hear the ring whisper to you. One day, you slip it on your finger where it shows you visions of gold and fame, while whispering "Mordor...Sauron...Return...";;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.0;No, it is evil and must be destroyed!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_mep_onering_events.0;No, it's mine. My Precious.;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.10;You learn that the One Ring has found a new bearer, it seems to have chosen [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.10; For now...;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.1;You decide to see to the ring's destruction, despite its temptations. After quickly outfitting yourself for the journey, you make your way towards Mordor. But no sooner does your journey begin that you find yourself pursued by a group of Warg Riders. The foul creatures and their beasts hound your steps for days on end but you finally manage to evade them by using the ring.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.1;It was necessary...;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.2;You cross wide plains and the great peaks of mountains on your tiresome journey, the ring seeming to grow heavier with every step you take. One night as you camp, you hear a shriek in the distance, the following morning reveals a Black Rider in pursuit. You try the Ring again, but the creature seems to home to it. As night falls, you reach a river and the creature refuses to follow across.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.2;Thank [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.3;Once you are sure you are safe from your pursuer, you make your towards Cirith Gorgor and the Black Gate. Unholy Darkness blankets the land as your reach the grand Gate, which you find closed. You hide away near the Gate until creaks open, an army of Orcs and Fellmen emerge from the farside. You race for the closing and sliding through, dropping your helmet as you do.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.3;*Grab helmet*;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.4;You make your way deep into Mordor as you slip past horde after horde of orcs in the ashy fields. You spend what seems like eternity without respite in the barren fields until, finally, you reach the base of the fiery Mountain. The Ring becomes a torment to carry as you trudge up the slope.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.4;Just a few more steps...;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mep_onering_events.5;You finish your torturous ascent and come to the Mountain's entrance, though the ever-increasing burden of the Ring overwhelms you, requiring you to rest for a time at the Entryway. You push yourself onward into the burning passage, where you soon come to the blazing abyss. Your hand stretches out a over the pit but despite your efforts, you can't bring yourself to release it. You pull your hand back.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_mep_onering_events.5;No, this must end here!*Release Ring*;;;;;;x
