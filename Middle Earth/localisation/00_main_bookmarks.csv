BM_THREE_KINGDOMS_DESC;At its height, Arnor borders extended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood down to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the river Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm included other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn Gorthad. After the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, the eldest son, Amlaith, claimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the region of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur. Human folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone the dream, Arnor was shaken by civil war between the three sons of Eärendur, Arnor was no more, divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in foolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their strength, enemies gathered on their frontiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_FALL_OF_ARTHEDAIN_DESC;During the reign of Eärendur his sons were in open discord, which erupted into civil war after Eärendur's death in TA 861. Amlaith, the true heir to the throne of Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers. Unable to resolve the situation, he was reduced to ruling the region of Arthedain, which consisted approximately of the lands west of the Brandywine River and north of the Great East Road. (His brothers created the kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur to the south.) The kingdom's capital was at Fornost, and Bree was one of its most important towns. Annúminas was in the territory of Arthedain, but mostly abandoned and falling into ruin. In TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern border. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not known to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself Arnor again. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_STEWARDS_OF_GONDOR_DESC;The Witch-king escaped to Mordor, and set up abode in Minas Ithil, which in consequence was renamed Minas Morgul. After the death of Eärnil and the coronation of Eärnur, the Witch-king challenged him to single combat, reminding him of the disgrace in the North. The Steward, Mardil Voronwë, persuaded him not to go. Seven years later, the Witch-king renewed his challenge, and this time, Eärnur could not be held back. Before leaving, however, Eärnur left his crown on the lap of his father in the Houses of the Dead. There it was picked up again by Faramir, the last Ruling Steward, for the coronation of Elessar almost a millennium later. With a small escort of knights, he rode past the gates of Minas Morgul. None were ever seen again. No new king was elected and the rule of Gondor passed to the Ruling Stewards, beginning with Mardil Voronwë. The Stewards were to rule "until the King returns", because it was uncertain at first whether Eärnur had been killed or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_FIVE_ARMIES_DESC;The middle of 28th century of Third Age brought forth the Long Winter, an extremely cold and long-lasting winter in Middle-earth  resulted in the deaths of many thousands of Hobbits in The Shire, covering Eriador, Dunland and Rohan, followed by the Days of Dearth, period of famine in The Shire which lasted into T.A. 2760., and wars of Rohan against Easternlings, Dunlendings and Gondor against Corsairs and Haradrim. After the wars, seeing Rohan's weakness, the Steward, Beren gave the keys to Orthanc to the wizard Saruman. In TA 2770, Smaug, a fire drake of the Third Age, considered to be the last "great" dragon to exist in Middle-earth, came from the mountains in the north, "like a hurricane coming from the North", drawn by great wealth amassed by the Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain, which included gold, gemstones, silver, pearls, the many-faceted crystals of emerald, sapphire and diamond, and the famed Arkenstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC;Middle-Earth, 3018th Year of the Third Age. I amar prestar aen, The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen, I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae, I feel it in the earth.  A han noston ned 'wilith, I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. These are dark times for Middle-Earth, large shadows spread in the East. Sauron, the Dark Lord, desperately looks for his Ring and is gathering all evil to him. Soon he will be ready to strike the Free Peoples. The kingdoms of Men are weak and in decline. Gondor seems to be the last realm with any chance of defending Middle-Earth. The Dwarves hide in the depths of their mountains, while the Elves flee to West. While Mordor prepares in the east, the traitor Saruman expands his domain into a weak Rohan, the Land of Horses. In these dark times the fates of all Middle-Earth lie with a single Hobbit, charged with a very dangerous mission.;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 3018 du Tiers Âge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KIN_STRIFE_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1427th Year of the Third Age. The peaceful kingdom of Gondor is approaching a perilous time in it's history. Valacar, son of Romendacil II of Gondor, married a non-Numenorean wife. Despite her being daughter of the mighty King of Rhovanion, Vidugavia, most of the lords of Gondor think that her son, Eldacar, is not a true Numenorean, and so cannot be king. Civil war threatens to tear apart the great Southern kingdom of men. In Eriador, both Rhudaur and Cardolan have been defeated by Angmar, and Arthedain seems the only realm that can stop a full invasion of Eriador. Will you play as the Witch-King, and complete the conquest of the North? Or will you play as Araphor of Arthedain, and try to save the last remnants of the Kingdom of Arnor from darkness?;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 1427 du Tiers Âge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FALL_OF_ARNOR_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1308th Year of the Third Age. This bookmark takes place roughly 1700 years before the events of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is a turbulent time for the successor kingdoms of Arnor, and the last light of the Dúnedain seems near to being extinguished. The three kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur, split from Arnor upon the death Eärendur have had a relatively peaceful period, but this is set to change with the rise of the Witch-King of Angmar in the north. His strength is growing and soon he will be ready to strike at Rhudaur, the weakest of the three kingdoms and, if successful, perhaps begin to bring the age of the Dúnedain to a close.;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 1308 du Tiers Age.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
