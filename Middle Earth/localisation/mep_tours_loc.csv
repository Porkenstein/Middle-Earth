EVTTTLmep_tours_events.1;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1gondor;You see the massive pinnacle of the White Tower, renamed in honor of Steward Ecthelion II, as you cross the Pelennor Fields, approaching Minas Tirith. In short order you pass the massive whitestone ringwall through the city gate and explore the city's tiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1rohan;You pass through the crowded city streets of Edoras, on the hilltop above you sits the Golden Hall, Meduseld, shimmering in the sunlight. Through the gate to the main road, along which the clear spring watersand Snowbourn flow. Before leaving the Harrowdale, you visit the ancestral tombs in the Barrowfield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1mordor;You enter the murky courtyard of the Dark Tower, it's fiery light painting the landscape a dusky crimson, as a sense of forbearance grows in you. The air hangs heavy on you, choked with sulfur and ash from ever-spewing Mt. Doom, making each breath a pain. You approach the keep itself but danger pushes you away and toward to the Northern Road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.1dwarf;Khazad Dum, Moria in the tongue of men, the endless stone halls constructed by the great king Durin the Deathless. But I mustn't be too loud for though my feet echo down the corridors which lead through the Misty Mountains I dare not stir my unwitting host lest my presence anger them. As I admire the exquisite masonry so too do I come upon the long and narrow bridge which crosses the great chasm below me, as I cross the deep abyss so too do I cross one destination off my list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.1;An incredible City;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.1;If only I could've met such Mighty Kings of Old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.1;I must find a way through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_tours_events.1;To Aglarond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.11;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11gondor;You come to the ruins of Gondor's once-jewel, awed by the sight even now in its delapidated state. You walk through the collapsed buildings and along the rubble-lined pathways. Eventually, coming to a mighty, but rundown, domed building as the day's light fades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11rohan;You turn off the Main road to Edoras towards the White Mountains. You reach the base of the mountains and spend a few minutes searching for the Stair of the Hold you were told about then make your way up the winding path to a large, grassy plateau. There, you look out on the vast plains of the Riddermark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11mordor;The horizon turns pitch black as you make your way towards the Black Gate. As you grow closer, sunlight barely passes the stoneworks. Enough light enters the area that you can makeout the structure of several Stone Turrets along the interior of the gate. When you reach the gate, however, the guards refuse you passage and you are forced to turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.11dwarf;Aglarond, the beautiful caves deep in the Hornburg, the very walls sparkle and shine as though they were so many diamonds spread about the intricate and complex formations of the cave as I stepped into it, its beauty was indescribable to me as I looked upon it. Walking through these caves my wish to never leave here took root and as such it did so sadden me when I departed this gem in the mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.11;The Grand Dome of Stars, Incredible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.11;Hello, hello, ello.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.11;There must be another way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_tours_events.11;Alas, I shall ever miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.12;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12gondor;The Stone road leads along the Anduin and onward to the Great Harbor City. You enter the city proper and make way through the winding paths, bleached stone buildings marking the boundaries. As you walk along, you come to a grand palace, its foundation submerged in the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12rohan;Light seems to die around you as you walk the shadow-cast, stone-lined roadway in the mountain. Carved in the mountain before you are the doorway trees of Dimholt and the Path of the Dead beyond but as you approach the doorway and read the engravings, a shiver runs down your spine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12mordor;You turn off the road to the north and to the Carach Angren, the narrow pass in the Mountains. You make your way through the many fortresses and watchtowers that line the pass and come to the bridge, but as you do, a riot breaks out amongst the Orcs of the pass which soon erupts into a full scale battle as more and more pour in. So you turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.12dwarf;Erebor, the one Lonely Mountain in a sea of flat plains and Laketown which rests at the foot of it, here it is that we have made home and where the beautiful gem the Arkenstone rests, as it is to be said that the heavenly object is though a piece of the stars themselves. As I enter through the strong and formidable gates do I feel at home within this bastion of dwarven craftsmanship. As I explore each and every hall and staircase so too does my pride grow in my people as I look on what they have built, and so too though does my envy grow of the king as I look upon the horde he amassed as I behold a sea of gold and in it gems spot the surface, diamonds rubies and more to behold and so do I find it hard to tear myself away from this masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.12;I can't believe it, Tarannon's Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.12;I must turn back, the way is shut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.12;What luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_tours_events.12;But the journey must continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.13;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13gondor;Long before you catch glimpse of the famed Tower, Tirith Aear, you hear a great toll carrying on the wind across the plains. The once faint ring grows into a crashing boom as you approach the tower's grounds. The guards eye you as you enter the grand structure, though you continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13rohan;You make your way across the plains of the Riddermark to the Grand Fortess of the Hornburg, built Ages ago by the Numenoreans. Pulling up your hood, you make your way inside. You sneak through the guarded door to the Deeping Wall and marvel at it's ramparts, noting the culvert and stream as you return to the Fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13mordor;You enter the pale-lit courtyards of the silent city, the ground all around you bathed in soft, sickly, white. The flowers of the great meadows corrupted by the touch of evil. You push yourself onward toward the ghastly, vapor-veiled citadel before you, its tower enveloped in the moonlight. But a wyerven shreiks and Orcs pour out of the gate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.13dwarf;Nogrod, the once prosperous Dwarven stronghold in the Ered Luin, the very stones of the mountain look as though they were blocks of ice so is their blue hue. It is here the infamous Nauglamir which lead to the murder of Thingol and his subjects in Doriath as the dwarves and later elves sacked it. But even for its association with such an atrocity still is Nogrod and the Ered Luin so beautiful as the mountains themselves create a masterpiece of colors that dances with the very sky as the snow on its tops mix with the clouds above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.13;I can't wait to look out on the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.13;What force could breach such a stalwart Citadel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.13;A Pox on this land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_tours_events.13;A wonderous sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.14;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14gondor;You enter the pale-lit courtyards of the silent city, the ground all around you bathed in soft, sickly, white. The flowers of the great meadows corrupted by the touch of evil. You push yourself onward toward the ghastly, vapor-veiled citadel before you, its tower enveloped in the moonlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14rohan;You hire a trotter and head for the East-mark region to visit the ancient city of Aldburg along the way. You arrive at the outergate shortly after Noon, turning in your rental, and, upon entering the city, are greeted by the clamor of bustling crowds and horses. The next day you continue your journey through Rohan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14mordor;You come to the high western passage of Cirith Ungol, at its pinnacle is the Blackstone Tower. You make your way up the steep slope and come to the Tower, casting off a cold shadowy light. You consider resting withint the lower walls but the Orcs screeching inside deters you. So you continue down the western slope and greet the plains of Gondor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.14dwarf;The beautiful and enchanting Grey Mountains, the home to the now abandoned and ruined halls of Dain I. It was here that the dwarven armies held back the orcs and drakes for years as they fell against the strong walls and doors that held us safe. But it is that nothing built can last forever, and the once beautiful halls now stand in shambles as I see pillars collapsing around me and where there were once amazing works of my kin's craftsmanship I now see not but faded memories of better days, when the world was fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.14;I must see it, no matter the cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.14;*To your pony*"Onward, Bill, into East-mark.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_tours_events.14;Finally, I'm free of this cursed land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_tours_events.14;Maybe one day the Dwarves will return to such glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.100;[tour_target.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.100;After your long journey throughout the land, you have finally return to your own realm. Seeing the outline of your palace in the distance, a sigh of relief escapes your lips.You've been on the road for quite some time, but you've finally made it home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.100;And there's no place like it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_tours_events.101;Lost on Tour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101A;You lose your way in a forest find yourself trapped in a room with a tomb. In the center is a pillar inscribed with - Cold be Hand and Heart and Bone, and Cold be sleep under---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101AB;You fail to discover the exit and return to the pillar to read the inscription again - Cold be Hand and Heart and bone, and Cold be sleep under---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101B;You wake and find yourself in a in a dimly-lit room. From a crack on the far wall, Moonlight seeps through and illuminates an inscription behind you - Nevermore to wake on Stony Bed, never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101BB;Nothing happens so you return to the inscription - Nevermore to wake on Stony Bed, never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101C;You stumble through ancient ruins, unable to find your way. You feel the wall and discover an inscription - till the Dark Lord lifts his hand over Dead Sea and Withered---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.101CB;As the ruin begins to fill with dirt, you rush back to the the inscription to find out what you've missed - till the Dark Lord lifts his hand over Dead Sea and Withered---;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTTLmep_tours_events.102;Found Treasure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.102A;You breathe a sigh of a relief as you emerge into a tunnel, ahead of you is the moonlight. You catch the glint of metal out of the corner of your eye. You dig up an anciet dagger, still sharp as new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.102B;You smile wide as you enter an open room, moon's light bathing you from a partially open door. You spot a pile of wood nearby and use a piece begin to pry open the door. As it opens you feel warmt from the staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_tours_events.102C;You burst forth into a cave, glad to be free from you previous confines. As you inch your way through the reciding darkness towards the distant light, your foot catches on some metal. You pick it up and find it unworn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.102;This will come in handy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_tours_events.102;The Power, Incredible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmep_tours_events.110;As you travel through the darkness, along back roads of Middle-Earth, you stumble upon an ancient tombstone, mired with ash of Ages past. Clearing it, you find old-Numer Runes, glowing in the moon's light. "Here lies the Fierce Iron Beagle, felled in brave battle against his many foes, his last words forever etched in this stone, 'I’m a Man of the West and the only reason I fight is for the pure joy of killing orcs.'";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_tours_events.110;A mighty Warrior of the Bygone Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
