	#Frodo Finds Ring
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.1;The Ring is Found;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.1;You enter Bag End after the birthday festival of my cousin Bilbo.As you open the door, an odd ring catches your eye from the floor. After picking it up, you see Gandalf staring at you, "What have you got there?" he bellows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.1;Show it to Gandalf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.1;Hide it in your pocket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.11;The Ring is Found - 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fellowship_events.11;You extend your hand and slowly unfurl your grasp to show him the ring. He reaches for the ring only to recoil from it and fall silent for a time. Suddenly, he bolts to the door, shouting "Keep it safe!" before departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fellowship_events.11;You slide your hand to your back pocket to hide your finde. But Gandalf grabs you and takes your hand. Only to recoil in fear and fall silent. After a time he bolts to the door, shouting "Keep it safe!" before departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.11;Wait, Gandalf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.111;The Ring is Found - 3;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.111;A worried Gandalf returns and tosses the ring into the fire. Shortly, he pulls it and places it in your hand. Strange writing appears and Gandalf grows pale. "You must go to the Prancing Pony and I to Isengard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.111;Are you sure Gandalf?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.112;Samwise Dropping Eaves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.112;Gandalf reassures you. Then a noise at the window draws him. In a flash he grabs someone "I ain't dropping no eaves!" Samwise cries. Soon, Sam is travelling with you at Gandalf's command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.112;On to Bree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.113;The Hobbitses Unite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.113;As you and Sam travel through the farms of the Shire, you see Merry and Pippin being chased by Farmer Maggot. You race after the pair to help, as well as invite them on your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.113;There's Safety in Numbers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.114;Black Rider Encounter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.114;Safely away from Maggot, you start to tell Merry and Pippin about your journey, but begin to feel the Ring growing heavy. The two begin eating vegetables as a Dark Figure appears in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.114;"Hide!" you shout to you companions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.12;Arrival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.12frodo;You dodge the Black Riders for a time as you travel to Bree. As you arrive, a man greets you and escorts you to the the Prancing Pony Inn where you learn of these "Pints".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.12aragorn;You pull up your hood as you arrive in Bree. "Gandalf should be here, somewhere." You assure yourself as you look around the village. As Darkness falls, you decide to find an inn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.12gandalf;Arriving at Isengard, you quickly make your way into Orthanc, declaring, "It has been found!" "I know." Saruman responds. You talk for a time, but, growing discomfortable, try to leave only to be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.12;I'll have one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.12;"Prancing Pony? Good enough.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.12;"When did Saruman the Wise abandon Reason?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.121;Flight From Danger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.121frodo;Sam, Merry, Pippin, and You drink several pint as night falls on Bree. And still, Gandalf has yet to arrive. "Where is he?" You think to yourself as you look about. You catch sight of a shady sort staring at you from the corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.121aragorn;The rest of the Little ones burst into the room as you reprimand with Frodo. Night's cover blankets the town as the Black Riders enter the Prancing Pony. Shortly, you hear their Shrieks and Frodo stirs from his slumber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.121gandalf;Saruman tortures you for a time.But, though, your strength has drained, you refuse to submit. Finally the wizard bores of the abuse and locks you away on in the Parapets of Orthanc. Days pass, then good fortune, an insect reaches you. Within hours, your friends arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.121;*Grasping the ring* "I have to hide.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.121;"We must away. Now.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.122;Camp at Weathertop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.122frodo;Strider sees you and your friends safely from Bree and the Black riders. As you march, Pippin goes on at length about 2nd Breakfast. Night's veil begins and Strider reveals himself as Aragorn. You set camp on Weathertop where your host departs to scout and you rest. You wake to the smell of bacon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.122aragorn;You hear the Ringwraith's shriek and race back to the camp to find the Little ones under attack by the Ringwraiths and Frodo nursing a wound. You take up a nearby torch and charge the closest Wraith, putting its cloak to flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.122;"Put it out you fools!"*A shriek rings out*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.122;"Away with you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.13;Events at Rivendell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.13frodo;You awaken to bright light and a dull pain in your shoulder. Scattered memories of a chase, Elves, and magic words fill your head, disappearing once you see Gandalf. He takes you to a meeting where elves, dwarves, and men soon fall into argument over who will carry the Ring to Mordor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.13aragorn;You sit quietly at the table as Frodo enters and discussion of the Ring break out. Boromir, Gondor's representive, suggests taking it to the White City and using it, causing you to stutter. It's decided the Ring will be destroyed instead and argument turns to who will carry it. The Little one steps up shouting, "I will take it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.13gandalf;The Council falls to squabbling about who will take the Ring. Annoyed, you rise, "Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul." The Council grows silent, so you declare the ring must be destroyed and the others agree, only to fall into bickering again. Then you hear Frodo, "I will take it!" ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.13elrond;You gather the Middle-Earth representatives in the Garden to discuss the Ring. As the squabble, Gandalf leaps up and recites the Ring's inscription. "Never before has any voice uttered that tongue here," you state. But it's effective and it is decided to destroy it. You hear, "I will take it!", then the council agrees to aid the Little one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.13;"I will take it!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.13;"If by my Life or Death, I can protect you. I will.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.13;"I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fellowship_events.13;"You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.131;Fellowship Journeys for Mordor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.131frodo;As you try to keep up with the Fellowship on the steep Pass, you slip and roll down the grade. When you've collected yourself, you see Boromir holding the Ring. Aragorn appears, the Ring is returned, and the journey continues. The progression proves perilous and the Fellowship soon looks to you to decide their fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.131aragorn;You come upon Frodo and Boromir on the Pass, in the latter's hand is the Ring. "Give it to Frodo," you exclaim and Boromir acquiesced. The Fellowship continues up to mountain until the treck falls to a halt, Boromir admonishes Gandalf for this path and suggests the Gap while Gimli boasts of Moria. Soon Gandalf looks to Frodo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.131gandalf;You guide the Fellowship in attempt to sneak past Isengard, but Saruman's spies patrol the plains, so you lead the party to the Pass of Caradhras to cross the mountains. But a fell voice floats through the pass, causing it to shake and storm. Boromir declares that it is too dangerous, suggesting the Gap and Gimli shouts Moria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.131;We shall journey to Moria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.131;Which way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAmep_fellowship_events.131;Let the Ringbearer decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCBmep_fellowship_events.131;Fly, you fools!*Call the Eagles*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.132;Doors of Durin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.132frodo;Gandalf leads you to the Doors of Durin, though you spend hours just outside as Gandalf thinks on how to enter. Finally he rises, declaring, "Mellon" and the doors creak open. But then you scream as something takes hold of your leg. Thankfully, Aragorn grabs you and severs the tentacle. While you enter, Legolas fires at the creature and the doors slam shut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.132aragorn;You and the rest of the Fellowship arrive at the Doors of Durin only for Gandalf to forget the password. Hour after hour falls away as you wait. Finally Gandalf declares "Mellon" and the door opens. As they do, Frodo screeches, a tentacle takes hold of him and drags him toward the water. Legolas fires on the Beast as you free Frodo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.132gandalf;The Fellowship makes it way to the lands of Moria and before long you come to the Doors of Durin. You look at the door with a slight smile, but quickly it fades. You've forgotten the password. Hours pass as you think, until finally Merry asks you what "Speak, Friend, and Enter." Means. "Not speak, Say." you think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.132;Frodo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.132;Everyone, inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.132;"Mellon";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.133;Fellowship in Moria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.133frodo;Gandalf speaks a spell and his Staff erupts with white light, then sets out through Moria's tunnels. He leads your party on to a great hall and you set to rest as Gandalf reads a Book. A wretch noise rings and soon you are set upon by Orcs and Trolls. The Fellowship fights its way to safety, though you were even struck by a spear, saved by your Mithril mail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.133aragorn;Gandalf leads on through the tunnels and eventually comes to the inner Chambers. There, the Fellowship rests and Gandalf reads the accounts. As he closes, Pippin makes a ruckus that draws the Orcs and Trolls. You and the Others fight desperately to safety but find Frodo has been struck by a spear. Fear fills you as you remove it. Only to discover Mithril.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.133gandalf;You use your magic to light the as you lead the Fellowship through the tunnels of Moria. Eventually, you enter a hall and find the last accounts of the Longbeards. Picking it up and reading, "We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the bridge..." As you finish, a wretch noise echoes through the tunnels as Pippin knocks down a corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.133;We have to get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.133;That spear would've skewered a wild boar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.133;Fool of a Took!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.134;Fall of Gandalf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.134frodo;The Fellowship retreats, every step harassed by the Orcs' Arrows. Soon Gandalf turns back, commanding you all to continue on. Aragorn drags you as he races on. You come to a Stairway and begin making your way down as it collapses. As you cross a bridge, Gandalf returns, battling a Fiery Beast. The falls through the bridge though Gandalf is dragged down as well. Shouting his last words, "Fly, you fools!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.134aragorn;You lead the way as the Fellowship retreats through Moria. Soon, Gandalf stops, commands you to continue without him, and turns back. You drag the Hobbits with you and arrive at a collapsing Stairway. As you jump down them, Gandalf returns through the doorway, followed by a Fiery Creature. He Fights off the beast as you pass the bridge, where it collapses. As Gandalf falls, he shouts, "Fly, you fools!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.134gandalf;You sense a great darkness as the Fellowship flees through Moria. "Your weapons are of no more use here," You exclaim, urging them to continue on ahead. You turn to face the threat, a Balrog, but soon find it your match and retreat towards the others. You find them at the Stairs as the Balrog smashes through behind you. The Party safely across the bridge, you turn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.134;Gandalf!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.134;Noooo..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.134;"You. Shall not. PASS!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.135;Fellowship in Lothlórien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.135frodo;Gandalf's death hangs over your continued journey, but Aragorn urges you all onward as the Orcs chase you. You narrowly avoid the threat until finally reaching the Great Forest of Lothlórien. There, after a tense standoff, the Elves allow you entrance and safety to rest. After a time, you meet Lady Galadriel, who shows you terrible sights of what's to come before gifting the Fellowship passage and boats. And at the Departure, she presents you an Elven Cloak and the light of Eärendil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.135aragorn;The Little ones are struck hardest by Gandalf's passing, but Danger still looms so you force them to their feet. You travel, ever weary, as the Fellbeasts hound your every step. 'Til finally, after a tense encounter, the Elves of Lothlórien Forest offer you temporary Sanctuary to recuperate. There, Lady Galadriel shows a keen interest in Frodo while the the Fellowship rests, but finally she offers you passage and boats. When Departure arrives, she presents you a Cloak, a Green Stone, and Scabbard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.135galadriel;You sense the Ring entering the forest, the Fellowship has arrived. So you dispatch Haldir to escort them to Caras Galadhon. He returns with them in short order, though absent Gandalf, and are allowed to rest and eat. You take Frodo aside to show him the Visions of the Mirror and manage to fend off the Ring. Rested, you give the Fellowship boats and meet them at their departure. To each you gift Cloaks then to - Frodo - you gift a Phial, Sam - a seed, Aragorn - a Stone and Scabbard, Legolas - a Bow, and the rest, belts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.135;Thank you, My Lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.135;"My Lady." As you bow your head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.135;May these gifts aid you in your Quests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.136;Events of Amon Hen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.136frodo;You came to a great Waterfall in the Anduin that forced the Fellowship from the water. At Amon Hen Boromir again presses you to travel to Minas Tirith. But in your refusal he attacks you, trying to take the Ring. You slip it on to flee as he shouts "You'll take it to Sauron!"  and Orcs surround the ruins. You finally realize what you must do and return to ships on the waters below the Fall, alone. Only for Sam to appear, "I must go alone" you tell him, but he stubbornly follows, "'Don't you leave him, Samwise.' He told me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.136aragorn;You set camp on the Seeing Seat to rest and continue on in the morning. Frodo wanders off alone and Boromir disappears soon after. An Ill feeling takes you so you follow, when you hear Frodo shout. You draw your sword and rush towards the shout to find Frodo removing the Ring, as you move to collect him, Orcs charge from the woods and force you to fight. Frodo's gone when you've won so you look for the others. Your search ends quickly as you hear the Blast of the Horn of Gondor and race towards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.136;Oh, Sam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.136;Boromir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.137;Lost in Emyn Muil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.137;After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Sam tried to navigate the winding paths of the Emyn Muil but he and you ended up lost several times. Only to be attacked by the creature Gollum, in attempt to take the Ring. Sam came to a plan and quickly captured Gollum, binding him with Elvish rope. As I watched the creature writhe in pain, pity took me so I stayed Sam's hand and decided not to slay Gollum, in exchange for safely freeing us from the path. Gollum then agreed to lead you to Mordor, on the Precious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.137;Very Well, lead on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.138;Journey through the Dead Marshes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.138;"This way Hobbitses," Gollum kept shouting as he lead you and Sam into the Dead Marshes, the cursed remains of  a battlefield from Ancient battles. You look into the pool and see a flickering flame "There's people, faces, in the water." You become mesmerized by the sight and start to follow it only for Gollum to grab you, shouting, "Avoid the lights in the water." He drags you back onto the path and countinues on through the dizzying array of pools.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.138;To the Black Gate, lead on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.139;Ithilien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.139;Gollum took us to the Black Gate as commanded, but stopped us from passing, shouting "Don't take it to him." Instead, he leads us towards 'The Stairs' but, after watching a battle, you are captured and taken to a hidden lair where you meet the Gondorian Faramir, learning he is Boromir's brother. Sam foolishly tells him of the Ring so he takes you, in chains, to Henneth Annûn. There, Gollum is captured, at my hand, to save his life. After much begging and pleading, Faramir relents on taking you to Minas Tirith and releases you on your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.139;'You have proven your quality' you nod in agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.140;Minas Morgul and Shelob's Lair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.140;Freed from the Rangers, Gollum once again leads you into Mordor. 'Up the Stairs and into the Tunnel' he repeats as you approach the meadows of Minas Morgul. Rather than through, he leads you up a narrow path in the mountain. Partway up, you fight with Sam and continue on with Gollum. Fear fills you but you do as bid and enter the tunnel, but soon Gollum disappears, leaving you to stumble on alone. You see light and rush forwards towards it, only to have a Giant Spider stab you with its stinger and wrap you up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.140;I'm so sorry, Sam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.141;The Citadel of Cirith Ungol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.141;You awake to find yourself on the ground, free from Shelob's webbing but missing the Ring. "I have to get out of here!" you cry, then from below you hear the sounds of battle. Fear filling you, you freeze up and pretend to be dead. The sounds of swords clashing and metal ring continues to grow closer, then you hear the door behind you swing open. "Frodo!" You hear Sam and turn to him, shouting, "They've taken it!" But he reaches in his pocket and pulls something free, "Begging your pardon...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.141;"It's my burden!" taking the ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.142;Meandering in Mordor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.142;Sam and you crawl through the barren plains of Mordor as you head towards Mount Doom. Along the way, the two of you pass through a company of Orcs marching west by wearing the clothes of the Watchers. Days passed without food or water, making every step heavy. Finally at your end, you give up and sit down beside a boulder. But Sam encourages you with talks of home. Then takes you up on his shoulders and carries you up the Mountain, exclaiming "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.142;I'd never gotten far without my Sam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.143;Mount Doom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.143;Gollum attacked us as Sam carried me and I fell. As Sam fought, I ran into the Crack and was about to hurl the cursed Ring into the fires when it spoke to me. 'My precious,' You say to yourself as Sam charges into the scene. "Hurl it into the fire!" He shouts, but you refuse and slip the ring on. As you try to escape, Gollum jumps on you, bites the Precious off your finger. He won't have the Precious, so you attack him. After a few moments of struggle, you and he tumble over the edge. Sam takes hold of you and cries, "Let it go.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.143;Let it go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.143;It's MINE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.144;The End of the Ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fellowship_events.144;Sam's pain spoke to you so you let go of Gollum who fell into fire below. Shortly after, the fire burst forth when Sam carries you from the Crack. Sam again encourages you even as Doom sets in. Then the sky parted and the Eagles appeared. The great beasts carried you to Minas Tirith where you recovered from your Journey. There, I was reunited with my friends, Aragorn, now King of Gondor, Gandalf the White, even Merry and Pippin were there, who told me of the wars and marvelous sights they'd seen. Then they looked to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fellowship_events.144;Despite Sam's cry, you determine to hold the Ring. But to no avail, Gollum slips free and falls into the fire. Sam drags you as the fires burst forth. Sam again encourages you even as Doom sets in. Then the sky parted and the Eagles appeared. The great beasts carried you to Minas Tirith where you recovered from your Journey. There, I was reunited with my friends, Aragorn, now King of Gondor, Gandalf the White, even Merry and Pippin were there, who told me of the wars and marvelous sights they'd seen.

EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.21;Meeting Frodo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.21;"...Strider."You overhear the keep say as you draw from your pipe. The little one begins to panic then you watch as the little one vanishes in a blink.A moment passes before the Hobbit reappears, and you take him away. Hours later, several dark figures enter town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.21;"You draw far too much attention to yourself, Mr. Underhill.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.22;Chase to Fangorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.22;'What do your elf-eyes see?' You called to Legolas, several days and nights into your pursuit of the Merry and Pippin. No rest, no meals, ever running. Then, a Red Sun rises and you see smoke on the Horizon. You begin to move, only for Riders to accost you. Finally freed, you continue to the battlefield, your heart filled with dread. But luck, you happen on a hobbit trail into the Forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.22;Into the Woods we Go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.23;Fellowship to Edoras;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.23aragorn;Reunited with Gandalf, he leads you and the rest of the Fellowship to the Rohan Capital Edoras to seek aid from King Theoden in the Coming War. You arrive in the Horse City filled with fear and misery as Rumors of illness and corruption reach you. Gandalf charges at once to the keep, where he bluffs his way inside, staff in hand. There, Theoden king, aged and ill, sits on his throne as Wyrmtongue whispers. Suddenly Gandalf uncloaks and marches forward, and Theoden is returned to vigor as the spell is lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.23gandalf;You've Reunited with the Fellowship, which fills you with joy. But more important matters require attention now, Isengard has too long had run of Rohan and you fear Edoras is in the middle of this. You arrive in a city heavy with meloncholy and chatter in the street speaks of illness and death in the Keep. You are greeted at the gate by guards who confiscate your companions' weapons, but manage to hold onto your staff. Inside, you sense Saruman's presence on the King and approach the throne, throwing off your Cloak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.23theoden;Wyrmtongue whispers in your ear day by day, filling it with tales of prosperity and mirth as you wile away your hours seated on the throne. One day word arrives of the death of your son, but Wyrmtongue is there to ease the news. You hear commotion and Grima whispers to you, "He is not welcome" which you repeat. But the White-clad man approaches and your mind clears. Taking up your sword, your stength quickly returns so you turn attention to Grima. "Your counsel would have me on all fours like a dog!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.23;"King Theoden." As you make obediences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.23;"You will not have him.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.23;Away with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.24;The War for Rohan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.24aragorn;Debate rages about how to respond to the plundering of Rohan. After a few rounds of raised Tempers, Theoden decides to withdraw to the Hornburg and the strength of the Deeping Wall to save Rohan. A decision that Gandalf greets with a scoff and frowning scowl. As the smallfolk collect provisions, you escort the ill-tempered Gandalf to the stables. There he speaks his intentions to seek aid for this foolish action, pinning his instructions with, "They will look to you for strength... The Defenses must hold.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.24gandalf;Rohan is in mortal danger and yet Theoden-King foolishly seeks to hide away in his keep and await slaughter rather than take the fight to the Evil of Isengard. He refuses to even wait to collect the scattered Rohirrim of the realm. You shake your head, "such foolish action," you scoff to Aragorn. As you mount Shadowfax, you look to Aragorn, "I ride now, they will look to you for strength. In 3 days, look for my coming. You must last 'til then. The Defenses must hold." Aragorn nods and you spur the White Horse out of the stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.24theoden;Gandalf rides off as you lead your people, with what meager possessions they can manage, across the plains. Along the way, wargs assault the column, killing a number of your riders, people, and horses. Though thanks to Aragorn sacrifice and his companions fighting so bravely, losses were kept to a minimum and your train makes it to Helm's Deep. As you settle into defenses, arming every man and boy capable of holding a weapon, Aragorn makes a miraculous return which bolstered the morale of your men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.24elrond;Long ago, an alliance formed between Elves and Man to stand against the darkness, side by side, but no longer. Now, your people flee to the sea dn the Undying Lands for safety, to leave Men to their fate. However, the Men of Rohan now face terrible odds as the forces of Isengard march towards Helm's Deep and the doom of Man. Will you flee and let the Doom fall upon Middle-Earth or will you Renew the Alliance and march to near-certain Doom and the Death of the Elves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.24treebeard;You complete the hellos at the Entmoot and turn to the matters of war. After a time, you and the Ents decide the dealings of Men and so conclude the meeting. As you escort the Little Ones back tot he shire, one of them urges you South. South always felt like down hill, so you agree. dawn's light begins to break as you reach a massive clearing. Saruman has cut down a huge swath of Fangorn, killing many of your friends. This is treachery, this is WAR!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.24;They will hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.24;Show them the meaning of haste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.24;I'll have them make such an End!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fellowship_events.24;The Alliance is Renewed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEmep_fellowship_events.24;Our business is with Isengard tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.25;March on the Black Gate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.25aragorn;Gondor and Rohan no longer stand threatened by the forces of Darkness, having stayed the enemy at Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith. What remains of them now hide behind the Black Gate, cutting Frodo, if he still lives, off from the fires of Mount Doom and the Ring's end. You must decide now whether or not to Risk a gamble, the remainder of the Strength of Men on an attack and possibly allow passage for Frodo or conserve your forces and leave Frodo to his Fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.25theoden;[From.GetFirstName] has taken [From.GetHerHis] station as King of Gondor, in all but name at the least. And now stands determined to march on the Dark Lord's lands with what Strength is left to Men to end the Darkness one last time. However, Rohan has has seen heavy fighting, from the Riddermark to the Plains of Penethor, what remains of the horses are spent and the Riders are wounded and exhausted of War. Will Rohan stand against the forces of Darkness one last time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.25gandalf;Rohan was held, now so to is Gondor, though not without heavy cost. Worse still, the forces of Darkness have retreated behind the Black Gate and many thousands Orcs, Trolls, and other Fell beasts now flood the Mordor plains. There is no way, if he still lives, Frodo can make the passage to Mount Doom and see Middle-Earth to true peace. Aragorn has put on the Mantle of King and, mayhaps, there is yet hope to be found in the Strength of Men. If the enemy can be drawn out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.25sauron;Saruman failed you in the West, the 'King' managed to halt you in the East. Still, they paid heavily for these small victories, all you need do is bide your time. But, the 'King' is a bold one, and even now, marches to toss his life and Men away by attacking the Black Gate. Meanwhile, the Ring calls to you from somewhere close, if you can obtain it, the End of Men will be all but guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.25;The Strength of Men is not yet spent. We March!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.25;Rohan Rides for Wrath and Ruin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.25;Then we leave our trust to 2 small Hobbits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fellowship_events.25;I must have the Ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.3;Torture of Gollum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.3;The Orcs found a wretched creature wondering in the lands of Mordor. You sense the Ring's touch on it and after hours under the knife and flame, the creature screams "Shire... Baggins!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.3;Find the Ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.31;Nazgûl Defeated on Weathertop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.31;The Nazgûl found the Ringbearer on Weathertop, however they were driven away by a Ranger wielding fire. but, despite failing to recover the Ring the Witch-king did manage to wound the bearer with his Morgul-blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.31;The wound will take him in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.32;War for Gondor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.32;Saruman has failed you as his Uruk-hai are proven inferior against the Horse-men, breaking on the Deeping Wall. Worse still, Men have had their morale bolstered by this minor victory and still the Ring eludes your grasp. As such, you are forced to call up your Orcs and the Men of the South to wash over the pittiable Men of Gondor, starting with that longstanding thorn, Osgiliath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.32;The Age of Man will soon end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.4;Gandalf arrives in Isengard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.4;Gandalf bursts into the room exclaiming, "It has been found!" after a short discourse, Gandalf begins to show ill-ease and attempts to leave. You have the doors barred and attack the Grey Wizard, quickly overcoming him. "I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.4;"You have elected the Way of PAIN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.41;War on Rohan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.41;You find Grima at the door, sometime after the loss of Dominion over Theoden. He explains that Theoden will respond to the plundering of Rohan by attacking, and failing that, will retreat to the Hornburg. 'Such a fortress will require a force never before seen, and even then it will surely break on the Deeping Wall.' But you have a plan to deal with that obstacle so command your orcs, 'March to Helm's Deep!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.41;Foward to War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.5;Ring of Power Resurfaced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.5;The winds bring word from Gandalf, the Ring of Power has once again revealed itself, in of all places in the hovel of a hobbit of the Shire. The bearer is making his way here, however the Menace knows of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.5;Return them here safely, Glorfindel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.6;Frodo Finds the Ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.6;You storm out of the hovel to research this ring. Several hours pass before you finally open Isildur's journal. "Surely, it can't be..." You deny as you read. '... A secret now that only fire can tell';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.6;"There, I'll prove it a false alarm.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.61;Battle of the Peak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.61;8 days you have battled the hellbeast, Durin's Bane, from the deepest depths to the peak of Silvertine. For two days you hack and slash at one another, until you draw your lifeforce and smote the beast. But [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is not finished with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.61;My purpose is not yet finished, I live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.62;Rescue of Merry and Pippin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.62;You arrive in Fangorn to see Orcs infesting its green wood as a plague. 'Saruman, how could you.' You begroan at the sight of cleared wood. One day as you recover from the Struggle and you see an Ent pass by, you pay him no mind, as you contemplation the Visions you've received. As your recuperation nears its end, you begin to hear the woods whisper of 2 hobbits in the woods and a chance meeting with Treebeard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.62;Good, Treebeard will see you to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.63;The Tide Turns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.63gandalf;The wood whispers to you of the return of a three old friends. As much as it will be to see the Fellowship again, though the news is more welcomed for the aid in the burden charged to you. "Gandalf?" Aragorn declares after your combative reintroduction. You smile and embrace one another, then start for the forest's borders and Edoras. Along the way, you discussion turns to the visions [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] imparted and new duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.63aragorn;You follow the Hobbits' trail deep into Fanogorn, where even the trees seem hostile. Legolas speaks of ancient times where the Elves spoke with the wood then stops and calls to you. "The White Wizard Approaches," he whispers, you attack but are easily subuded. As you look on the visage, you find an Old Friend. He tells you of Future's vision and the Forces of Isengard that stand ready to burn Rohan to ash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.63;I return now at the Turning of the Tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.63;Then, to Edoras with all haste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.71;The Horn of Gondor Found;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.71;A patrol from the Anduin arrives, racing quick-step into the Throne room as you feast. You stare them down and continue your feast. As you finish the last tomato, one of the guards approaches and places a bent and broken hunk of metal on the table before you. As you eye it, you recognize it as the Horn of Gondor. Boromir's Horn. In such shape, it can only mean one thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.71;My Son is DEAD!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.72;War for Gondor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.72denethor;The Death of Boromir weighs ever heavy upon your mind. Even as the Darkness of the East descends on the Lands of Gondor in the form of Mordor Orcs, ever encroaching on West shores of the River. If only Boromir were here to defend Gondor against this Evil, standing strong, brave, steadfast, and shimmering against the Darkness as he used to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.72aragorn;As you stare out to the surrounding cliffs, you see a great spark flash in the distance, and then another. In gravest haste, you race into the Hornburg where King Theoden sits in Council. "The fires of the Mountain have been lit. Gondor lights the beacon, Gondor asks for aid." A silent moment passes, broken with the words, "Rohan will answer." As Theoden rallies the Riders, you realize too few have arrived and so must take a different path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.72gandalf;With the Beacon fires lit, you now can only trust to Theoden to meet the call and ride to Minas Tirith's defense. You take hold of Pippin as you and he look out over the horizon, where both land and sky are awash in black, the Dark Lord blocks the sun to protect his hordes' and ease their passage as they march ever onwards towards Gondor's Destruction. The Doom of Man and the failure of your mission now stand before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.72theoden;The Beacon fires of Gondor are lit, Minas Tirith calls for aid. After a moment's respite you rally the Rohirrim, Rohan will answer the call. You send messengers to every corner of the Realm to gather all the Riders Rohan can muster. But as the Eastern Darkness grows ever closer, you must leave now with what few you have gathered or Minas Tirith will surely fall. As Dawn's rays crest the mountain range, you and your Rohirrim head for Minas Tirith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.72;Gondor will Fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.72;The City must hold. Courage is our Defense now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.72;Our way is through the Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fellowship_events.72;Rohan Rides to War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.73;Gate Breached;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.73denethor;The enemy forces swirl on the Plains of Penethor outside the Gate, unable to make breach or storm, while your men pour stone and steel upon them, slowly you are winning the day. "Never has the Gate been breached, nor will it." You declare as the force of Darkness clear way for a great Ram to approach, amidst chants of "Grom!" But your prediction is shown false as the mighty Gate bursts after just 3 blows from this Grom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.73gandalf;You ride to and fro along the battlements, offering encouragement to the Men defending the walls and gate as the Forces of Darkness fight hard and desperately to take them. But no sooner than the defense has stabilized, that the enemy wheel up a mighty Ram, as they chant "Grom. Grom. Grom!" The grand mechanism sets in place in front of the gate, and after just 3 terrible blows, the Gate bursts in and Orcs pour into the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.73sauron;The Orcs begin to break against the stout defense of the walls, so the Commander calls forward the Fearful Ram, Grom. As it is wheeled forward, even the beasts pulling it are strickened with terror and begin to run wild amongst the battle, trampling Orc and Man as they do. Once in place before the Gate, the terrible Ram rears back and smashes against the Gate. Once, then again, and on the third crash, aided by Spells of Ruin, crashes through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.73;Minas Tirith is Felled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.73;Men of Gondor, you will stand your ground!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.73;Of course Grom would breach it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.731;Osgiliath has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.731denethor;Long have the forces of Darkness spilled from the lands of Mordor to plague Gondor. But the Men of the Guard and Rangers have kept them on the Far side of the Anduin since Boromir's liberation. No longer, however, as Faramir reports to you and the council that he has failed to hold the ancient Capital of Osgiliath, losing more than a third of the Gondor's best warriors as he did so. Such a betrayal is no doubt treason in deed if not by law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.731gandalf;You watch out over the horizon as the forces of Darkness pour across the Anduin River. Before long, you see the Rangers and Soldiers fleeing from the river and ruined city, their flight dogged by the Nazgûl. You and Shadowfax race out to escort the routing troops, casting a blinding spell to ward off the enemy. The Soldiers barely dehorsed, the Council declares that Osgiliath must be retaken and Faramir acquiesces, at his father's insistence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.731sauron;The Armies of Men have for too long stymied your Orcs' attempts to cross the Anduin River. No longer, your Commander has had a great many floats and barges crafted with which to forge on across the river. With your dark magic obscuring light, your Orcs manage to cross, and, despite determined opposition, seize control of the Western Ruins. Even now the Witch-King and Nazgûl nip at the heels of the fleeing defenders, killing atleast a third all told. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.731;Faramir's uses were always few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.731;Stay this Madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.731;Soon the Armies of Men shall meet their end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.74;End of the War for Gondor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.74denethor;Thanks to the command of Gandalf, the White City has held. For the glorious Charge of the Rohirrim plus the timely arrive of Aragorn's dunedain, the Orcs are broken.The forces of Darkness lay dead in droves outside the gate and in. Littered amongst them are the noble bodies of Gondor's soldiers. Gondor's saftey is bought with a heavy toll, but the lands are now safe, for a time atleast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.74aragorn;You arrived on a field of carnage, Men and Horses, Orc and Fellbeast, even a number of the Giant Oliphaunts, lie dead, strewn about the ground. With a great shout, you,  flanked on either side by Gimli and Legolas, led your Dunedain into battle and slayed many Orcs and Easterlings before the battles end. Gondor finally stands safe for a time as what's left of the Darkness retreats, you realize it is now time for the King's Return to the White City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.74gandalf;You command a desperate defense of the streets as Orcs and Easterlings pour through the gate. A fierce fight broke out with the Witch-King's forces on the 2nd level, when Rohan arrived and saved the city, followed by the Dunedain and Aragorn which broke the forces of Darkness and made safe the City.  Gondor is safe for a time and the Rightful King is in the White City, the Armies of Men have their leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.74theoden;You and your Rohirrim arrived on the outskirts of the battle as the Forces of Darkness pour through the Gate. A Glorious Charge by the Rohirrim saw the enemy infantry broken, though the Mumakil were a much tougher opponent. Thankfully Aragorn arrived with Dunedain reinforcements and saw the Day truly won. Now the forces of Darkness flee fast towards Mordor and stand on the defense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.74;The White Tree Stands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.74;The White Tree Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.74;Men, yet, still Stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fellowship_events.74;A Red Dawn Rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.81;Retreat to Helm's Deep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.81;Rohan burns as the Orcs of Isengard, supplemented by the treacherous mountain-men, raid far and wide. They burn and pillage every village they cross. It has grown out of control, with no safety in the realm. As your thoughts turn over the problem, they fall on the Dunlendings invasions of years pass and how the Rohirrim withstood it. So your mind clears, the Deeping wall will hold, and Rohan will stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.81;Helm's Deep will save my People again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.82;Deeping Wall Breached;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.82theoden;As you prophesized, the Orcs of Isengard break upon the Deeping Wall, as your men fight valiantly against the ceaseless waves. But Saruman is a weaver of Dark Magic and before you know what's happening, a great gust of flames erupts from the Deeping Wall. Stone, blood, and bodies rain down on the field as the ancient wall explodes into a plethera of pieces. The Deeping wal is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.82aragorn;You've raced along the Deeping wall for much of the night, giving courage to the defenders with bloody interdiction against the enemy sappers. As you call for a volley, the wall beneath you begins to shake with Sound and Fury, immediately after a great flame erupts through cracking stone and you are sent flying to the ground behind the wall. You make your way to your feet, your head spinning, as you see the enemy flooding in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.82saruman;Your mighty Urak-hai struggle to scale the great Deeping Wall, falling in such high numbers, the enemy is making sport of the battle. But you have Dark plans in the works, simply awaiting your word. You call to your Berserkers and issue the order to breach the wall. Soon after there is a great cacophony that stretchs even to the walls of Isengard itself, the Deeping wall shatters into innumerable pieces and your forces pour inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.82;Retreat to the Keep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.82;"Forward!" *You shout to the defenders*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.82;Rohan will soon fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.83;End of the War for Rohan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.83theoden;Your ride out of the Hornburg along the ruins of the wall, along with the Arrival of the Rohirrim with Gandalf, as well as a forest of Huorns, has seen the end of the enemy forces. The Deeping wall smoulders and the fields are littered with the dead, but, lo, Rohan still stands and Isengard is no longer a Threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.83aragorn;You joined Theoden in his ride out of the Hornburg and saw many of the enemy Urak-hai dispatched. As Dawn broke, Gandalf joined the Frey with the remains of the Rohirrim and a forest of Huorns encircled the bloody field, together you saw to the end of the forces of Isengard. Rohan no longer stands Threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.83gandalf;As Dawn broke on the fifth day, you arrived on the fields of Helm's Deep to see Theoden leading a charge along the Deeping wall, or rather the ruins where it once stood. From your flank, Erkenbrand called for a charge and his Rohirrim joined the battle while a forest of Huorns saw to the end of any enemies who fled the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.83;A Red Dawn, Rohirrim!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.83;Now we must look to the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.83;Sauron's Wrath shall be fierce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fellowship_events.84;Glorious Charge of the Rohirrim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.84denethor;The Gate has been breached by a great Ram the Orcs called Grom, which allowed them to pour into the city's lower level. As the defenders are pushed back to the second level, a great Horn sounds in the distance followed by Thousands of shimmering Riders cresting the hill. They let out a chorus of shouts and charge into the flanks of the forces of Darkness, slaughtering a great many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.84theoden;You crest the hills surrounding the Plains of Penethor just as Dawn breaks behind you. The Horns sound and your Riders meet you. Before your men lie a host of Orcs and Easterlings pouring into the shattered city Gate and overwhelming the defenders. You order your lines as the forces of Darkness make a disordered attempt at forming up, then you fall to encouraging your men, "Arise Riders of Rohan!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fellowship_events.84gandalf;You've spent the night rallying routing wary recruits and stabilizing defenses, though the gate fell to Grom and forced you to fall back to the second level. But Dawn's light brings a sliver of hope as Horns sound in the distance, followed by thousands of Rohirrim. They form up on a hilltop and charge forward into flanks of the enemy, casting a brilliant bolt of light from the sun's reflection as they do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fellowship_events.84;Rohan has answered our call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fellowship_events.84;Ride for Ruin and the World's Ending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fellowship_events.84;Hold to hope, we are not done in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTTLmep_misc_events.3;Fly. You Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_misc_events.3;Gandalf stimbles upon the idea to call the Eagles for aid. Shortly the Eagle King arrived and carried the Fellowship high into the sky, past the Dead Marshes, and into the Plains of Mordor, to the Crack of Doom. There Frodo drops the Ring into the fiery pit and sees it's end. Soon enough all Middle-Earth settles into peace, free from the clutches of the Dark Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
