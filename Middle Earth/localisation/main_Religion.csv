#RELIGION DESCRIPTIONS
religion_eruhini_DESC;The cultural traditions and beliefs of this character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_enyd_DESC;The Ents are large sentient, humanoid beings created at the request of Yavanna to protect the trees from other creatures, particularly Dwarves, and thus were called "Shepherds of the Trees". They mainly protect the Huorns, creatures much like Ents although not truly sentient, as well as the normal trees of the forests they dwell in and wander. \n\nThey are found in Fangorn Forest, named after the oldest Ent left in Middle-Earth. \n-------------- \n§YCultural Bonuses§! \nEnt: \nTroop Combat: §G+2000.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-75.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-100.00%§! \n\nHuorn: \nTroop Combat: §G+1500.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-50.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-95.00%§! \n\n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nOrganisation: §G+100.00%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§! \nCombat in §YForest§!: §G+20.00%§! \nCombat in §YWood§!: §G+20.00%§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_khazad_DESC;The Dwarves, or Khazâd in their own tongue, were beings of short stature, often friendly with Hobbits although long suspicious of Elves. They were typically blacksmiths and stoneworkers by profession, unrivaled in some of their arts even by the Elves. \n\nWhile there were several tribes of the Dwarves, the most prominent was that of the §YLongbeards§!. The others were the §YFirebeards§!, §YBroadbeams§!, §YIronfists§!, §YStiffbeards§!, §YBlacklocks§!, §YStonefoots§!, and the Petty-dwarves. Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves are not counted among the Children of Ilúvatar. Their creator was Mahal, known as Aulë the Smith. \n-------------- \n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nTroop Combat: §G+400.00%§! \nOrganisation: §G+100.00%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-75.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-95.00%§! \nCombat in §YMountain§!: §G+20.00%§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_eldar_DESC;The Elves, or Eldar, were the first of the races of the Children of Ilúvatar, known also as the Firstborn for that reason. The Elves are distinguished from the other two main races, Men and Dwarves, especially by the fact of their near immortality. \n-------------- \n§YCultural Troop Combat Bonuses§! \nSilvan/Avari: §G+250.00%§! \nSindar/Nandor: §G+400.00%§! \nNoldor Combat Bonus: §G+500.00%§! \n\n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nOrganisation: §G+100.00%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§! \nLevy Size: §R-75.00%§! \nLevy Reinforcement Rate: §R-95.00%§! \nCombat in §YForest§!: §G+20.00%§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_perian_DESC;Hobbits, Halflings or Perians are a small race that typically dwell underground. They are generally farmers and traders, happy with a simple life of plenty. The Shire is famous for its inns, pipe-weed and mushrooms. \n\n Hobbits are generally shy of other races, except in the town of Bree where they mix happily with the Big-folk. Their main contact is with Dwarves who cross the Shire while travelling to and from the Blue Mountains. They originated in the Anduin Vale on the East side of the Misty Mountains in the Third Age, before migrating West to what became the Shire, where the three strains of Hobbit, §YFallohides§!, §YHarfoots§!, and §YStoors§! mixed. \n-------------- \n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nTroop Combat: §R-0.50%§! \nOrganisation: §R-0.50%§! \nMorale: §G+100.00%§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_edain_DESC;The cultural traditions and beliefs of this character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_corrupted_wight_DESC;Wights, also known with the Sindarin name of Gordain, are powerful Spirits which can take possession of dead bodies and often have great knowledge in Dark Sorcery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_corrupted_orkish_DESC;Orcs are the footsoldiers of evil overlords - Morgoth, Sauron and the Witch-king of Angmar. They were created by Morgoth before the First Age in mockery of the Elves, but their exact origins are unknown. They are almost tribal, with hierachy being dependent mainly on strength. \n\nThey are generally divided into two groups, §YOrcs§! and §YGoblins§!. The Goblins are those Orcs that live in the dark caves of the Misty Mountains. Orcs are shorter than Men but can vary widely in appearance and height. \n\nOrcs are generally weaker than Men or Elves, in part because they are merely copies of the true creation of Ilúvatar but also because of their lack of discipline.  \n-------------- \n§YRacial Bonuses/Maluses§! \nTroop Combat: §R-50.00/-20.00%§! \nLevy Size: §G+100.00%§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
religion_corrupted_dragons_DESC;Dragons were first bred by Morgoth as giant soldiers in the War of the Jewels. The descendants of those great dragons are a greedy scourge on the Dwarves, hoarding treasures that they gain from attacking Dwarven kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
