EVTDESCyears_of_the_trees.1;While the Valar dare not tread upon Middle-Earth for fear of rending the Earth, they have not abandoned its people.  The Maia Airen has risen into the Eastern skies of Middle-Earth, travelling with untold swiftness and bearing a raging fire of unknown origin. The skies of Middle-Earth are now filled with a warm brillaince, which the Sindar have already named 'aur' - daylight.\n\nAs Arien falls beneath the western horizon, the Maia Tilion becomes visible.  As bearer of the last fruit of Telperion, Tilion's light is not as brilliant, neither marring the view of the stars nor driving away orcs, although it does reveal enough of the world to bring sight to the eyes of Elves\n\nAlthough no replacement for the Two Trees, these new lights will surely aid the children of Il√∫vatar in their struggle against Morgoth.;;;;;;x
