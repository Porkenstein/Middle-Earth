BM_RETURN_OF_THE_NOLDOR_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Gwirith 1497, the Years of the Trees.    Millenia of peace known to Middle-Earth have ended forever.  The Great Enemy, The Dark Lord Melkor Morgoth Bauglir, has returned to Angband from his imprisonment in Aman, and is breeding a host of evil creatures in Dor-Daedeloth, the land of darkness.  His eventual goal can only be the usurping of Eru's creation with his own, and the destruction of all of the Children of Ilúvatar.  Rumors whisper of his crown bearing three great jewels, which shine with an unearthly light.  Further rumors whisper still of a great host of elves from beyond the sea, the Noldor, whose mighty lord seeks retribution for the jewels' theft, the murder of his father, and the destruction of the Trees of Valinor themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,

ERA_CHAR_NAME_3238;Fëanor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3238;Curufinwë Fëanáro was the creator of the Silmarils and the second High King of the Noldor after his father, Finwë.  After the destruction of the Two Trees in Valinor, their light remained only in the Silmarils, which were stolen away by Morgoth to Angband.  Fëanor, full of pride and wrath, made an oath to Eru with his seven sons to make enemies of any and all who would keep the Silmarils from them.  Upon making this oath, they left for Middle-Earth with the majority of the Noldor people.  The Noldor, in need of transport across the Belegaer, took the ships of the Telerian Sea-Elves of Alqualondë by force of bloodshed.  This kinslaying would prove only to be the first in the long struggle to reclaim the Jewels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3056;Elu Thingol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3056;Elwë Þindicollo was born in the earliest days of the world, when all of the firstborn dwelt in Middle-Earth.  Whilst wandering the forest of Nan Elmoth, Elwë met the Maia Melian, and the two became entranced.  During their time together caught in this spell of love, the Eldar began to leave Middle-Earth, invited by the Valar to Aman after the Chaining of Melkor.  The majority of Elwë's people, however, refused to leave without their leader, and resided in Beleriand under his rule.  In the thousands of years since, Elwë became known as Elu Thingol, and his people as the Sindar. His realm of Eglador was the peak of elvendom in Middle-Earth, and his union with Melian protected it from Morgoth's designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3167;Denethor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3167;Denethor, son of Lenwë, was a lord of the Nandor, elves which never sought a life over the sea in Valinor.  By the time of Morgoth's return, Denethor's people, the Laegrim, had migrated over the Blue Mountains to found the Kingdom of Lindon.  Long had Denethor, Cirdan, and Thingol been allies, and in Y.T. 1497, they found themselves honoring that alliance as the Dark Lord prepared to unleash a great host of orcs against them from the north. This battle, the First Battle of Beleriand, would decide the fate of all Elves henceforth in Middle-Earth, and prove to be the end of Denethor's unified kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10015;Morgoth Bauglir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10015;Melkor was the first, most powerful being created by Eru.  As the remainder of the Ainur came to be and joined in the Theme of Ilúvatar, Melkor found himself clashing with it.  As other, lesser Ainur joined with Melkor's rebellious creation, the Wars of the Valar began, with Melkor reigning in Middle-Earth and the Valar in Aman.  The ensuing battles shaped the Earth through their cataclysms, culminating in Melkor's imprisonment in Aman.  With his servants awaiting his return in the North of Middle-Earth, he plotted his vengeance and began a campaign of deceit, feigning repentance.  Turning the Noldor against the Valar and stealing the Silmarils, he fled from Aman to reclaim his dominion on Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10025;Gothmog;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10025;Gothmog was originally one of the Ainur whom Melkor corrupted at the beginning of creation, and gained his name with his rank as the Lord of all Balrogs.  Following Melkor into exile in Middle-Earth, he became one of the Dark Lord's most trusted servants, equalled only by Sauron.  When Morgoth returned to the North and rebuilt his ancient fortress of Angband, he made Gothmog its High Captain and Vanguard leader of his armies.  In the following centuries Gothmog would prove his worth by slaying Noldorin High Kings, shattering kingdoms, and fighting the greatest warriors on the Earth at the bidding of his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3065;Nowë Círdan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3065;Nowë Ciryatan, later known as Círdan the Shipwright, was one of the great elf-lords of old.  When his friend Elwë remained behind in Beleriand, he and his kin refused to depart to Valinor and instead built the great havens of the Falas, dwelling on the western shore of the Hitherlands for thousands of years.  While the suppliers of commerce and transportation throughout much of Beleriand, the Falathrim were neither authoritative nor warlike, until war and peril were forced upon them in 4282.  Morgoth's first move upon his return to Middle-Earth was to send forth two great hosts, one attacking East Beleriand and the other attacking the Falas, which would soon find itself hopelessly beleaguered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3129;Fingolfin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3129;Ñolofinwë Aracáno was born in Tirion to Finwë and his second wife, Indis.  After a rivalry with Fëanor which culminated in the burning of the ships at Losgar, Fingolfin found that in order to honor his word he must cross the Helcaraxë, the great Grinding Ice connecting Aman to Middle-Earth.  Morgoth, the Valar, and Fëanor considered this impossible, but Fingolfin defiantly led the greatest host of Noldor in Eä easterward.  While many died, including his wife Anairë, he and most of his host arrived in Lammoth twenty years later, driving back Morgoth's armies even to the Gates of Angband.  With Maedhros's abdication, the burning of the ships was forgiven and Fingolfin became High King in 4314.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3239;Maedhros Russandol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3239;Nelyafinwë Maitimo, the eldest son of Fëanor, followed his father and brothers across the sea to Middle-Earth.  He was captured by Morgoth in a disasterous battle, but was rescued many years later by his old friend Fingon, son of Fingolfin.  As Maedhros regretted the divide between the houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor, he sought a mending by abdicating the throne to Fingolfin in thanks.  While this eased the people of Fingolfin," his brothers named themselves ""dispossessed""", taking up lands in the east of Beleriand.  Maedhros himself, possessed by hatred for Morgoth and haunted by the pain of his imprisonment, took up leadership of the Siege of Angband in a great fortress on the hill of Himring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3146;Finrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3146;Artafinde Findaráto was the eldest son of Finarfin, who eventually became High King of the Valian Noldor.  Finrod followed the host of Fingolfin, separating with both his father and his beloved Amarië, in order to lead his people to Middle-Earth.  As the realms of the Noldor were established, Finrod alone held the friendship of his kin Thingol, the greatest lord in Beleriand.  This influence would aid him and his sons, Aegnor and Angrod, greatly in the coming centuries, and (as Finrod desired), prevent war between the two elven kindreds.  Holding realms in Dorthonion initially, the Noldor of the house of Finarfin would eventually become protectors of all West Beleriand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3242;Caranthir the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3242;Morifinwë Carnistir was the fourth and most wrathful of the sons of Fëanor.  His harshness and strong independence led him to Thargelion, far from the realms of Doriath and Finrod, where for centuries he aided Maedhros in his wars against Morgoth and held an uneasy yet profitable alliance with the Dwarves of the Ered Luin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

Saved by Maedhros while attacked by Orcs on the Dwarf-Road, Azaghâl offer the prince both an alliance and a gift of the Dragon Helm, crested with an image of Glaurung, the Father of Dragons.  During the great battle to come, Azaghâl would meet face-to-face with Glaurung and his offspring, acheiving both legendary victories against Morgoth, and equally legendary defeats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
