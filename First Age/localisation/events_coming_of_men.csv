# RUMORS OF THE AWAKENING MANY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST RISING OF THE SUN

EVTTITcomingofmen.1;The Awakening of Men;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.1;Rumors are finally reaching Beleriand on the tongues of Avarin travelers from the east. The promised Secondborn children of Ilúvatar, the race of Men, have awoken at a place called Hildórien and begun spreading across Arda at an alarming rate. Their peoples have learned the tongues of the Dwarves and the Avari, and already speak with reverence of the first rising of the Sun.  These short-lived beings are fickle, easily abandon one place in favor of another, and breed like insects.\n\nSoon their race may hold dominion over all lands in Middle-Earth. One pressing question remains: will they be our friends, or our foes?;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.1;These beasts must not be allowed to usurp our place.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.1;It is a gift from Eru to defeat the hordes of the Enemy!;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.1;Fankil, return to Umata and bring these Men to the cause.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDcomingofmen.1;The race of Men will be neither unified nor fickle. We must take caution.;;;;;;;x

# THE FORODWAITH SETTLE THE WILDERNESS IN THE NORTH

EVTTITcomingofmen.2;The Forodwaith;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.2;The first of the secondborn race have come to Beleriand.  The Imehwäke, as they call themselves, are fair-skinned semi-nomads who live by hunting and gathering in the frozen north.  Their nature is largely a mystery to us, but their resiliance against the corrupting influence of Melkor is adimrable.  The Sindar have come to call them the Forodwaith after the northern lands that they inhabit.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.2;They should remain far away from our lands.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.2;Excellent! I cannot wait to meet these newfound friends.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.2;Food for the wargs. Excellent.;;;;;;;x

# THE WILDERNESS IN ANACH IS SETTLED BY FORODWAITH

EVTTITcomingofmen.3;The Anachrim;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.3;The few rangers accustomed to the perilous land of Nan-Dungortheb have begun to report something new and impossible.  Surrounding the stinking spider-holes wherein dwell the demonic spawn of Ungoliant are what appear to be carved Cirth, stone idols, and sacrificial offerings.  It seems as though in exchange for worship and tribute, the evil denizens of Anach tolerate the Forodwiath which have settled as neighbors in the valleys surrounding the Ered Gorgoroth.\n\nThe wise say that this development makes travel in Anach even more perilous.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.3;Such strange people, these northmen...;;;;;;;x

# THE BATTLE OF PALISOR OCCURS OFF-MAP

EVTTITcomingofmen.4;The Battle of Palisor;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.4;Word has reached us of a great battle fought far beyond the Hithaeglir on the plains of Palisor.  It seems as though the secondborn children of Ilúvatar struggle to resist the power of Morgoth, and those defeated in the battle by the servants of the Great Enemy are few in number and struggling to survive. A demon-lord, some say a lieutenant of Melkor, no less, has apparently posed as a Mannish god-king and unified the corrupted peoples of Hildórien into a great kingdom of darkness.  The Avari who fought alongside the uncorrupted men were utterly destroyed, and the dominion of Morgoth grows in the East daily.\n\n These Lintador, the uncorrupted wandering peoples of Men, have turned West, hearing rumors of a peaceful land under the protection of Lord Greymantle.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.4;Ill news indeed. The enemy has triumphed in the East.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.4;So, Fankil has triumphed. Our victory will soon be at hand.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.4;They will be sorely disappointed.;;;;;;;x

# THE EDAIN ARRIVE

EVTTITcomingofmen.5;The Edain;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.5;Dwarven traders have begun to tell tales of the Men calling themselves the Atanatari, the 'Fathers of Men'.  These great hosts of Edain include the ancestors of those fleeing from the battle of Palisor, although some among them have never even heard of the event.  Most of the Men, in fact, dwelt in Eriador before being driven out by some great threat moving westward, itself fleeing Palisor and ravaging the land in its path.  While the Dwarves have not seen evidence of these 'Easterling' men, the Edain are eager to tell of them and their brutal, warlike ways.\n\nThe elves may have an ally in these Edain, but the fathers of men and their pursuers both may fall under the sway of the Dark Lord despite all that has occurred since their awakening at Hildórien, for the memories of the secondborn are short.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.5;I must seek these Men out as an ally.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPcomingofmen.5;You go on a quest to bring tidings of friendship to the Edain.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.5;These vagabonds are of little consequence.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.5;I will warn my people to avoid them and their filthy encampments.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDcomingofmen.5;These creatures are too dangerous to be left alive.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDTOOLTIPcomingofmen.5;You organize an expedition to find and exterminate these Men.;;;;;;;x

# THE SWARTHY MEN ENTER BELERIAND

EVTTITcomingofmen.6;The Swarthy Men;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.6;It seems that the flight of the Edain was not unfounded. Hordes of horseback-mounted men of the Palisor, short of stature and dark of complexion, have made their way through the passes of Caranthir into Lothlann.  They are called the Baradhrim, and although not corrupted by Fankil as their Aravadorim kin are, the Baradhrim are no less dangerous or uncivilized.\n\nThey are divided into several warring chiefdoms, not yet unified in purpose beyond survival.  Despite this, rumours state that the Easterlings seek in their hearts to conquer all the lands of Beleriand.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.6;We must raise our fortifications and sharpen our swords.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.6;We must ally with these powerful warriors!;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.6;They will bow before Angband, or die.;;;;;;;x

# AN EDAIN HOST LEADER BECOME CORRUPTED

EVTTITcomingofmen.7;The Fall of the [FromFrom.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.7;My lord, grave news has reached my ears. It seems as though the folk of [FromFrom.GetFirstName] have forsaken decency and reason and have sworn alleigance to the Black Enemy Morgoth!  They have banished any in their newly settled domain who will not worship Bauglir, and forbid any contact with the Eldar, whom they refer to as 'white devils'.  Surely their lands will be embroiled in war, and agents of the Enemy will run rampant throughout Beleriand.  Perhaps we should act?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.7;[This.Religion.GetHighGodName] save them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.7;Typical of Men. There is no hope for their race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.7;Perhaps a wise move on their part...;Les dieux mongols sont forts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# AN EDAIN HOST LEADER REJECTS THE ELVES

EVTTITcomingofmen.8;The Edain and the Eldar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.8;My lord, I have just received word from a traveller who sought passage through [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decreed, with support of the lords among his people, that relations with the Eldar are prohibited and the Men of [FromFrom.GetBaseName] will not suffer any dealings with 'meddlesome' elf-lords.  The traveller was turned back by armed men with with bows drawn.\n\nIt appears as though the influence and friendship of elves is no longer welcome to this particular group of Men, surely to the detriment of Beleriand's safety.  Perhaps future generations of Men will soften and lose this antiphathy to their firstborn neighbors... or perhaps the situation will deteriorate into war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.8;What can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.8;Things will be better off this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# AN EDAIN HOST LEADER ACCEPTS THE ELVES

EVTTITcomingofmen.9;The Elf-Friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.9;My lord, I have just received word from a traveller who was invited to the court of [FromFrom.GetBaseName]. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has declared his intention of friendship with the Eldar and open opposition to Morgoth, at the expense of his peoples' safety, for the good of Beleriand.  This is monumentous, and opens up opportunity for pacts and alliances!  Perhaps we should consider offering a fiefdom, in exchange for a guard on one of our marches?  The Edain are brave and warlike, and would make powerful additions to our forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.9;Wonderful! We must reach out to our new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.9;We will offer nothing to these leeches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THINGOL ALLOWS THE HOST LEADER OF THE HALADIN TO SETTLE IN BRETHIL

EVTTITcomingofmen.10;The Woodmen of Brethil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.10;Rumor has reached our ears of a new realm in Brethil, that forest of wanderers and petty elf-lords. Thingol has relaxed his grip over the land, allowing the folk of [From.GetFirstName] to settle there and claim its kingship, in exchange for aiding the watch on the fords of Brithiach. This signals a change in policy for Thingol, who has previously been inflexible in his dealings with outsiders. The wilds and watched ways of Beleriand alike will be much safer for all the free peoples of Eru now that the western route taken by Orcish raiders is closed off, guarded by the axes and bows of the [From.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.10;A new age of peace for Western Beleriand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.10;Greymantle has clearly lost his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.10;Our new neighbors have arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# DAN SENDS A LETTER ABOUT THE EDAIN

# AN EDAIN LORD SWEARS FEALTY TO AN ELF LORD, LEAVES THE HOST AND IS GIVEN A COUNTY/DUCHY

EVTTITcomingofmen.12;The [FromFrom.Culture.GetName] in [From.GetBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.12;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn fealty to [From.GetBestName] of [From.GetBaseName], permanently settling [FromFrom.GetHerHis] people in the lands of [FromFrom.GetBaseName] as subjects of the [From.Culture.GetName] [From.GetRulerTitle].\n\nRecognizing a need for warriors to aid in their struggle against Morgoth, the Nobility of the [From.GetFullBaseName] have accepted an arrangement to share land with their strange new Mannish neighbors in what they hope will be a long-standing arrangement of peace and prosperity.  Some elf-lords have even raised the possibility of swearing fealty to Edain high lords, blending societies and even families openly, to the protest of the more conservative elements in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.12;The sons of Ilúvatar, brothers at last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.12;What next? Fiefdoms for animals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# FRIENDLY OR UNDECIDED EDAIN SETTLE A WILD REGION

EVTTITcomingofmen.13;A Realm of the [From.Culture.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcomingofmen.13;The host of [From.GetFirstName] has ended the long plight of its [From.Culture.GetName] people by settling in the wildlands of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]. The local lords have found themselves overwhelmed, but are largely happy with the possibility of strong, friendly neighbors and trading partners.\n\nWith a great new realm of Men among the lands of Beleriand, the power of the Dark Lord is further dilluted.  Only time will tell if [From.GetFullBaseName] is worthy of being counted alongside the Kingdoms of elf-kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.13;May they find peace in this new land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.13;Curse these usurpers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcomingofmen.13;Our new neighbors have arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# A LETTER FROM DAN ABOUT THE EDAIN

EVTDESCcomingofmen.14;My lord Finrod, if you have power over these newcomers, bid them return by the ways that they came, or else to go forward. For we desire no strangers in this land to break the peace in which we live. And these folk are hewers of trees and hunters of beasts. Therefore we are their unfriends, and if they will not depart we shall afflict them in all ways that we can.\n\nLenwë Dan Nos Nelyar, lord of the Nandor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.14;We must give the secondborn a chance to aid us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.14;Very well. I will try convincing them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# FANKIL RECEIVES ORDERS TO GO EAST

EVTDESCcomingofmen.15;Fankil,\n\nYou may have heard rumour that the time has come for your long labour in Umata to bear fruit. The secondborn awaken, and will soon meet the blades of my children. Go back to Palisor, my faithful servant, and ensure that they fight together for our world, not each other in needless bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.15;Yes, my lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# UNFRIENDLY OR CORRUPTED EDAIN SETTLE A WILD REGION

EVTDESCcomingofmen.17;[From.GetDynName] has ended the long plight of his [From.Culture.GetName] people by settling in the wildlands of [From.GetBaseName]. The locals have found themselves overwhelmed, and any opposing lords have been killed or driven out by force.\n\nRangers and wardens find this land to now be fenced off by their new neighbors, and the belligerent secondborn refuse to treat with the high lords of Beleriand.  Only time will tell if [From.GetFullBaseName] proves to be a danger to the free peoples of Arda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.17;I weep for this troubled land...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCcomingofmen.18;My friends, I have been in contact with Lord Dan of the Laegrim, who expresses grave concerns with me that I sympathize with.

# THINGOL SENDS A LETTER TO THE EDAIN

EVTDESCcomingofmen.20;I find myself beset by two problems. Orkish raiders from the Ered Engrin use the fords of Brithiac to raid through the sparsely peopled lands of Brethil, and the Edain pressure my subjects on the borders of my realm. In need of shelter, food, and grazing land for their beasts, the secondborn are a disaster in the making. Perhaps I can turn this second problem into an asset, and offer them the forest of Brethil in exchange for protection from ork-raids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.20;These new allies will make our lands safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.20;No, this may have unintended consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCcomingofmen.21;My friends, I know of your flight from the east and your desire to find a new home. Beleriand is already peopled for the most part, but I find my subjects in the bountiful forest of Brethil beset by orc-raids even so.  If you would bolster the defenses on the fords of Brithiac, I would grant this land and all of its inhabitants to the stewardship of your noble people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcomingofmen.21;Our new homes await in Brethil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcomingofmen.21;No, we will not be your thralls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THINGOL INVITES US TO SETTLE IN SOME WILDERNESS

EVTDESCcomingofmen.22;Firstborn emissaries from Doriath have arrived at our encampments. They point to [target_settle_duchy.GetName], a bountiful land sparsely populated by their kind, in need of protection from the forces of the Dark Lord. The lords of Beleriand offer us these broad lands in exchange for peace between our peoples.\n\nWe could resettle to [target_settle_duchy.GetName] immediately and create a legitimate realm of our own, free from conflict with Ossiriandic tribes... but we would be surrounded on all sides by mighty Eldarin lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
