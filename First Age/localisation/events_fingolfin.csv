# Fingolfin's host arrives at the Bay of Tuor (then just called the northern part of Lammoth)
EVTTITfingolfin.1;The Arrival of Fingolfin;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.1;The journey has been long and costly, you and followers wearied beyond measure. Each kinsman lost to the bleak wastes of Araman, however, stoked our wrath.  Your half-brother, Fëanor, brought your folk into kinslaying and banishment, finally abandoning them by burning the ships meant to bear them to the East.  By forcing you to choose between a disgraceful return to Tirion or a treacherous march across the Helcaraxë, he declared himself an enemy of the folk of Fingolfin.\n\nAt the first rising of the Sun, you take your first steps upon the hitherlands of Middle-Earth.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.1;We must find my treacherous half-brother.;;;;;;x

# the Battle of Lammoth
EVTTITfingolfin.2;The Battle of Lammoth;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.2;The Dark Lord, it seems, is aware of our arrival and your intention to dethrone him.\n\nThe scouts returning from Lammoth report that a force has appeared to cut us off and destroy our people!  A teeming host of thousands of orkish warriors, led by a half-demon Boldog-lord, are but days away from your encampment.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.2;We can expect no aid. Prepare for battle!;;;;;;x

# the death of Argon
EVTTITfingolfin.3;The Battle of Lammoth;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.3;The day is yours, as the hollow children of Morgoth are no match for the power and grace of the Eldar.  But your folk are not without losses, as you discover to your horror.  Argon, your youngest son, fought bravely in leading a charge to the orkish lines, hewing a path through the foes and killing the orc-demon captain.  Alas, he now lies dead on the cold field of Lammoth.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.3;Morgoth, you will pay for this!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.3;Fëanor, you will pay for this!;;;;;;x

# emissary from Maglor (regent of Maedhros), informing him of the current situation with maedhros and feanor, fingolfin and his host react and decide to encamp in hithlum
EVTDESCfingolfin.4;Dear Uncle,\n\nLord Fëanor has fallen in battle with Gothmog and his host of Balrogs. The High King, Maedhros, has fallen into the hands of the Enemy.  We welcome you to Hithlum to join our opposition to Morgoth on the shores of Mithrim.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.4;I will join your host in Hithlum, but my folk are not inclined to friendship.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.4;This news brings me sorrow, but my folk must not encamp so near our enemies.;;;;;;x

# fingolfin reaches the great gates but morgoth is hidden fast within.
EVTTITfingolfin.5;The Great Gates;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.5;Your forces approach the tall shadow of Bauglir's gates, two mighty Brass doors, stark and seamless, flanked by great towers.  Your warriors raising banners and thundering horns, you smite your weapons against the edifice with no response.  The Dark Lord cowers in his labyrinthine halls, his legions of pathetic servants cowering in fear of the new Sun.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.5;Seriously, not even an ambush?;;;;;;x

# Fingon begs you to assault in order to rescue maedhros.  can attempt this but canonically realizes its impossibility and heavy cost.
EVTDESCfingolfin.6;Father, Maedhros is imprisoned in cruel torment upon the cliffs of the Thangorodrim.  We must drive forward past the gates and fight upwards to rescue the High King!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.6;I am sorry my son, but this would be disasterous.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.6;Your love for Maedhros moves me. Breach the gates!;;;;;;x

# tensions between the two hosts.  can actually come to blows.
EVTTITfingolfin.7;The Hosts of the Ñoldor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.7;Disputes, denouncements, and even duels have increased in frequency among the Ñoldorin lords of Hithlum as tensions between the folk of Fingolfin and that of Fëanor approach a breaking point.  Without a mediating influence to calm your furious kinsmen, civil war may be inevitable.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.7;I will take the high ground. No more Ñoldorin blood must be shed.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.7;Our peoples' differences will never be reconciled. The kinslayers must kneel!;;;;;;x

# maedhros abdicates to fingolfin.  fingolfin has no choice but to forgive the people of feanor and end the fued.
EVTTITfingolfin.8;Maedhros Returns;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.8;The valiant efforts of Fingon have amazed Ñoldor of all houses.  In recognition of his friend's bravery, and in a gesture of reconciliation between their peoples, Maedhros has abdicated the High Kingship to his uncle, Fingolfin. The new High King has made a declaration of friendship, ending forever the feud between the two great houses of the Ñoldor.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.8;May we be forever unified!;;;;;;x

# after the feast with the sindar, turgon, finrod, angrod, aegnor leave with their houses to settle new lands and create new citadels for defense against Morgoth.  you offer them luck and alliance, or demand fealty if proud.
EVTTITfingolfin.9;The Sundering;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.9;The folk of Finrod and Fëanor have followed their lords to new realms in the eastern lands of Beleriand, to oppose Morgoth from positions of strength and to govern large swaths of wilderness and new peoples of the firstborn.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.9;I wish them luck!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.9;You are still Ñoldor, and will therefore remain my subjects!;;;;;;x

# fingolfin has nightmares about the first kinslaying
EVTTITfingolfin.10;The Nightmare;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.10;You are walking the beach of the city of pearls, the tower of Olwë on the horizon. The blue water turns red with blood... running from your sword.\n\nYou find yourself experiencing these nightmares more and more often now, reliving the kinslaying you had thought to be in just defense of your sworn Brother.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.10;I cannot live like this.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.10;I must persevere, for the sake of my people...;;;;;;x

# fingolfin silently curses the fate of the noldor, pondering the centuries in regret.
EVTTITfingolfin.11;The Fate of the Ñoldor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.11;As you have tended to be plagued with nightmares the past centuries, you spend sleepless nights pondering the fate of the Ñoldor. The moon was a sign of hope, appearing the eve of your arrival on the fair lands of Middle-Earth.  But this hope proved tainted by lies and treachery, which spread still throughout Middle-Earth. Perhaps the Ñoldor deserve to endure this misery - after all, Mandos voices the mind of Eru, and it was he who cursed them..;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.11;We must revive this spirit of hope, in defiance of the Valar.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.11;We can only do penance for our crimes in hope of returning to Aman.;;;;;;x

# fingolfin reacts to the dagor bragollach, ride of rochallor, duel with morgoth and death
EVTTITfingolfin.12;The Ruin of the Ñoldor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.12;The siege of Angband is broken, the long war lost! Scattered reports have reached you - of friends and their entire hosts of bannermen dead, burned alive by the fires of Thangorodrim.  The lands of Beleriand have been tainted and the light of the sun blotted out by the choking ash of Dor Daedeloth.  The ruin of the Ñoldor is nigh, their realms laid bare for the ravages of Morgoth's hosts.  All that remains is vengeance. And perhaps, redemption.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.12;Rochallor, let us ride one last time.;;;;;;x

EVTTITfingolfin.15;The Fall of Fingolfin;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.15;The King has fallen, and the tale of his end brings shock and sorrow to the hearts of all Ñoldor, even in the midst of the Bragollach.\n\nIn wrath and anguish, it is said, Fingolfin rode alone to the gates of Angband, a terrible figure of glory and might reminiscent of the Great Rider Oromë.  It was there in the shadow of the Thangorodrim that Fingolfin met his fate, in single combat with the fallen Vala Morgoth himself.  Before he was broken by the Hammer of the Underworld and intered to a cairn by Thorondor, the valiant lord is said to have wounded the Dark Lord seven times.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.15;Oh, woe! Praise our king!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfingolfin.15;Good riddance...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfingolfin.15;A deed of valor... and sorrow.;;;;;;x

EVTTITfingolfin.16;The High King in Hithlum;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfingolfin.16;You are Fingolfin, the greatest Ñoldorin lord in Beleriand. Half-brother to Fëanor, the High Kingship fell to you when Maedhros abdicated to mend the feud between the two great houses. Your house reigns in Hithlum still, over a subject people throughout Dor-Lomin and Mithrim. The house of the late Fëanor the Great rules over independent realms of Eastern Beleriand, as it seems that Maedhros's prideful (and perhaps resentful) brothers are unwilling to reign as vassals. You should be wary, High King, of their ambition, but above all you must keep the watch on Angband. If Morgoth's hosts are allowed once more to roam Beleriand freely, then the age of Elves in Middle-Earth will surely yield to one of orcs and demons.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfingolfin.16;I will rule in strength and honor.;;;;;;x
