# lelaith dies of the evil breath

# lobbodor speaks to turin about the easterlings

# your father does not return from the nirnaeth.  you fear for him.  the easterlings come, enslaving dor lomin

# you are led out of dor lomin to stay with your kin thingol.  you arrive in the court of thingol, he becomes your guardian and stepfather

# you come of age, thingol gifts you your father's things.

# you join the marchwardens, to the schagrin of mablung. after some time in the marchwardens mablung is proved wrong. you become good friends

# saeros expresses his dislike of you in court.  rivals.

# you worry about your kin in dor lomin.  thingol stops sending scouts after one party does not return.  you ponder the possibility of going yourself (gain strong claim on dor lomin)

# saeros and you have an altercation during a small feast of marchwardens.  this leads to the duel, where saeros drowns and you are banished. (thingol realizes this was a misunderstanding and sends beleg to find you and bring him you back).  you immediately become lord of the gaurwaith, and an event explains how it happened

# you have some conflicts with the outlaws, showing your intention to hunt orcs rather than rob travellers

# you come across mim and his sons, come to an agreement where mim lets you stay in amon rudh.  capital is moved.

# after creating d_dor_cuarthol people start to flood in, offering their swords in service.  new holdings appear and the gaurwaith grows.

# narrative event to all about the Black Sword of the South

# a host of orcs from the north attacks brethil.  The chieftain of the haladin asks for your aid.

# a host of orcs attacks ivrin from dor lomin. the lord of ivrin asks for your help.

# sauron sends a host to assault neldoreth.  beleg urges that you send aid, but you think that mablung can handle it and the shame is still there from the banishment.  you dont feel that you can face your stepfather again.

# orcs find a secret entrance to amon rudh (betrayed by mim), sneak in, and kill your companions and take you prisoner.  Beleg (or mablung if beleg is dead) rescues you but you kill him in the confusion.  anglachel breaks and you go insane, wandering the wilderness.

# you are found by gwindor, who takes you to the healing pools of ivrin (or a house of healing if ivrin is tainted.).  he grants you a county and introduces you to Orodreth.  he swears to keep your identity secret.

# you meet findulas, having several friendly encounters (become friends).  She offers her love and you either accept (become lovers) or deny out of loyalty to gwindor.

# you join the rangers of amon ethir and fight the orcs which now roam what was once dor-cuarthol.

# orodreth find out who you are from finduilas, if she is in court (else finds out through someone with a loose tongue visiting from doriath).  he grants you the title of the warden of the lanthiranth, and begins tutoring you in architecture as his father did.  you become his trusted advisor.  turin reforges the shards of anglachel into gurthang.  gwindor offers you the dragon helm which you had given to him for save keeping.  turin trains nargothrondim triops, becomes marshall.  eventually turin leads construction of the bridge of narog, revealing nargothrond but opening up supply lines for campaigns against morgoth


# narrative event to everyone about the Black Sword of Nargothrond

# orodreth suggests a campaign to retake tol in gaurhoth. you dismiss it as too ambitious canonically, but can accept the idea which makes orodreth happy and gives bonuses.

# glaurung begins his invasion of nargothrond.  every time he does something significant you are notified. when his army reaches nargothrond theres a duel event which ends with turin being wandering away in a trance. when he occupies nargothrond his blast destroys all of the other buildings and the war ends with him taking the kingdom title. simeltaneously turin is granted a county in taeglin and a narrative event fires explaining how turin met the outlaws and visits finduilas' grave.

# you are filled with wrath at the easterlings and go there seeking answers.  you find none and kill the easterling lord.

# event where you meet the lord of brethil who explains to you how badly they need help.  you vaguely explain your expertise at orc hunting and he grants you a county, moves your vassalage up, and makes you marshall.

# you meet ninniel on the tomb of finduilas and nurse her back to health.  you both fall in love.  an event follows up where your friends respond positively to her. an event follows where the lord of brethil falls in love with her.

# ninniel begs you to stop fighting the orcs now that you will be a father.  you either accept her demand (you resign as marshall and both are happy) or deny (you both become stressed and she dislikes you)

# word of a great host of orcs led by glaurung himself reaches your scouts.  you decide whether or not to take up the mantle of defense (make both you and ninniel stressed, gain control of the levies of brethil and become marshall), or step aside (leave it to the chieftain).  you promise to ninniel that you will retire after this darkest hour, don the helm and draw the sword once more.  ninniel learns who you really are.

# if leading brethil, event to all about the Black Sword of Brethil

# glaurung invades brethil.  if he wins, he destroys ethil brandir and conquers all of brethil, destroying all holdings in the forest.  if he fails, then turin's plan to kill the worm comes into effect.

# when going to fight glaurung avranc volunteers and you pick one other between hardang, brandir, and (other).  if you pick brandir, he runs in fear.  if you pick hardang, you succeed but he dies.  avranc runs away.  (other) draws the attention of the dragon and a dragon duel commences.

# if glaurung is dead you go to taunt him.  drawing your blade, his poisonous blood knocks you out.  ninniel finds you, and glaurung opens his eye and undoes the spell.  she sees you "dead" wraps your hand, then commits suicide.  turin wakes up, goes back and argues with the people, killing brandir after hearing him speak of nienor and thinking he's lying, speaks to mablung and learns the truth, then commits suicide.

# mim gains control of nargothrond in a feverish attempt to regain his peoples lost realm via the wealth of the noldor.  hurin slays him if hes free and alive, and morgoth gains control in an event.  hurin gives the nauglamir to thingol.  thingol gets the idea to combine them into one great work and pays nogrodrim dwarves handsomely for it.  they kill him when its complete and the elves kill the dwarves.  melian flees middle earth in her grief.  a survivor lies to the king of nogrod who launches a rival war with dior.  if the dwarves reach menegroth the king takes the nauglamir and silmaril.  the elves of ossiriand join with their ally  beren, who joins the war.  when win, recover stolen stuff. 

# mablung and the people of brethil erect astanding stone in memorandum of turin and ninniel, telling of how he saved brethil and they died tragic deaths.
