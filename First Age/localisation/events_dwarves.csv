# Dwarven Mining Expedition
# councillor finds out 
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.0;There's talk in the local guild halls of a party of ambitious pioneers, miners, and migrants looking for a patron to help them embark on a mining expedition into the wilderness. Investments such as these are risky, but often very rewarding...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.0;I'll see if my lord is interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.0;Don't we have enough mines already?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# random event 
EVTNAMEMEP_dwarves.1;A New Fortress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.1;Your [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetFirstName] has approached you with news of a small group of ambitious dwarf pioneers, miners, and migrants from the realm who wish to found a colony in the wilderness of [target_mining_target.GetName], and strike the earth in search of unfound riches. Once embarked, they will build a subterranean fortress in the stone, hopefully the foundation of a new dwarf-hold and a return on the investment. They are in need of a sponsor to purchase some expensive supplies and an expedition leader to wield authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.1;I shall fund their expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.1;Well, good luck with finding them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.1;I shall lead them personally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_D.1;Why don't you go in my stead, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Councillor is informed
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.19;My lord [From.GetFirstName] has asked me to find a group of adventurous pioneers willing to journey for fame and fortune in unclaimed lands, beneath untapped hills, cliffs, and mountains. The guild halls these days are fair teeming with greedy prospectors and unemployed miners who would certainly jump at the opportunity to liven things up and make a nugget or two of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.19;Let's see what tunnel rats I can flush out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# councillor says 'ayeaye' to character/targetted decision
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.2;My lord, I will do some investigating and return to you with any volunteers that I can muster. There are seldom a dearth of greedy, stir-crazy dwarves around here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.2;Make it so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# nobody is available
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.3;My lord, I gravely apologize, but there don't seem to be enough volunteers interested in a mining venture. It seems that most of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s adventurous prospectors left for the last colony we founded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.3;Seriously!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# no land to settle
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.4;My lord, I gravely apologize, but there don't seem to be enough volunteers interested in a mining venture. It seems that nobody beleives that there are any unoccupied lands left in this corner of Middle-Earth worth mining. Perhaps consider a military expedition instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.4;Perhaps I will...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# character/targetted decision
EVTNAMEMEP_dwarves.5;A New Fortress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.5;Your [From.GetJobTitle] [From.GetFirstName] has returned to you with volunteers for the quest. A small band of ambitious dwarf pioneers from the realm are willing to take the journey to found a new mining colony in search of unexplored wonders and untapped resources. From the guild halls, the drinking halls, and all manner of other, er, halls they come, with one common purpose - adventure.  And fame and fortune, of course, but that's not what matters. This group is a motley crew of tough dwarven entrepreneurship at its finest... it is, however, in need of an expedition leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.5;I do suppose that I should hire a leader as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.5;They'll need to pick one from amongst themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.5;I shall lead them personally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_D.5;Why don't you go in my stead, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# where to go? (character decision only)
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.6;The mining company is assembled, the pickaxes sharpened and the ox-cart's axles greased up. With a twinkle in their eyes, the colonists ask where you plan on sending them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.6;Unpeopled wilderness is our safest choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMEP_dwarves_A.6;You send the company to the [This.Holder.GetFirstName] of [This.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.6;The sparesly peopled mountains of the North hold great promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMEP_dwarves_B.6;You send the company to [This.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.6;We shall claim a place where we know there are riches, occupied or not!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMEP_dwarves_C.6;You send the company to [This.GetName], in the lands of [This.Holder.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_D.6;Actually, I've changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPMEP_dwarves_D.6;You cancel the expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The company departs

EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.7;The colonists have left for [target_mining_target.GetName]. Time will tell whether or not the expedition results in financial gain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.7;I hope this doesn't end in disaster...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The company departs with you
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.8;You have left for [target_mining_target.GetName], a long road ahead with good company and a promise of future wealth. You find yourself very glad that you decided to supervise this investment yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.8;Ah, I do love a good adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The company arrives, you see them off.
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.9;Since arriving in [target_mining_target.GetName], the company has dismantled the ox cart and begun the long process of digging into the cliffside of the most promising hill.  As a gate is cobbled together from the cart bottom and the first meeting area dug out, you nod in satisfaction and begin the journey home on your pony.  Next spring, you will send a resupply caravan to trade for the riches the brave dwarves find beneath the earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.9;Have Fun you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The caravan is ready
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.10;It's been a year since the mining colony in [target_mining_target.GetName] was established, and the resupply caravan you arranged for is ready. The great ox-drawn wagon is filled with necessities to be traded with the pioneers for whatever riches they are sure to have drawn up from the earth. The broker and guard captain assigned to the caravan are among the best, the guildmaster assures you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.10;I'm coming with you. Let's go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.10;I cannot afford to be away from court right now. Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.10;I eagerly await news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - cannibalism
EVTNAMEMEP_dwarves.11;The Caravan Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.11;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. The exterior of the place is littered with the bones of dead orcs and an enormous pile of unidentifiable refuse lies adjacent to the closed drawbridge. Hailing the gatekeeper produces no reply.\n\nTaking the hidden door common to most fortresses, you emerge in the empty halls amid a grisly revelation.  The colonists must have been starving when struggling through the winter, for they apparently butchered and ate each other! Those who survived this horror likely starved to death anyways, as there are no survivors to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.11;These idiots couldn't farm mushrooms?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - tantrum spiral
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.12;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. The exterior of the place is littered with the bones of dead orcs and an enormous pile of unidentifiable refuse lies adjacent to the closed drawbridge. Hailing the gatekeeper produces no reply.\n\nTaking the hidden door common to most fortresses, you emerge in the halls amid a disturbing revelation. It appears as though the colonists all went mad and murdered each other!  If there were survivors they fled into the wilderness. Naught walks the halls now but an unusually large number of cats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.12;They must have run out of beer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - orcs
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.13;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. The exterior of the place is littered with the bones of dead orcs… and are those the bones of dwarves? As you hail the gatekeeper, the fortress’s sturdy drawbridge begins to lower.\n\nWith a sinking feeling, you realize that the multitude of figures emerging from the entrance are not the pioneers, but orcs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.13;Drop the wagon and run for your lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.13;Draw your axes! Khazâd ai-mênu!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - poor outcome
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.14;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. The exterior of the place is littered with the bones of dead orcs and an enormous pile of unidentifiable refuse lies adjacent to the drawbridge entrance. A moat beneath the bridge is filled with stinking viscera.\n\nShrugging off this unpleasant welcome, you greet the filthy, wild-eyed mayor of the new fortress and eagerly ask to see what wealth they have to trade. As the caravan settles into their ramshackle trade post, you find yourself greeted by racks upon racks of cat-leather socks, roughly carved limestone mugs, and cumbersome stone slabs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.14;Let’s just give them their provisions and get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.14;If they don’t have anything to trade, they can’t have our food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - normal outcome
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.15;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. The exterior of the place is littered with various kinds of neatly sorted industrial and agricultural refruse. You cross the moat into the well-fortified entryway and begin unloading your wares in the fortress's spacious trade post.\n\nThe mayor of the fortress greets you, gives requests for future supplies, and presents you with a broker. The broker-dwarf has haulers produce various gems, precious metal bars, and crafts of middling to fine craftsdwarfship. It seems that they have done well for themselves in their new home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.15;Let’s do some business!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.15;The food is yours, my friends. Reinvest your newfound wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# The arrival - great outcome
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.16;After a long journey you approach [target_mining_target.GetName]. Although it’s hardly been a year, the colonists have already constructed enormous statues of you flanking a grand entrance framed by smooth granite walls. The colonists, together with a horde of new migrants and laughing children, come running out of the fortress to greet their [Root.GetTitle].\n\nAfter exchanging niceties, your caravan enters the fortress, and you admire the carefully smoothed and ornately engraved walls of the hallway. The trading post is stacked with riches - gem-encrusted gold jewelry, superior weaponry, and masterfully crafted steel mechanisms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.16;I am without words!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# aftermath

# The mayor swears fealty
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.17;The mayor of the new colony in [target_mining_target.GetName] has met with your liason. If you wish, it could be elevated to a full Barony, the mayor made a lord of the realm under your vassalhood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.17;Of course! They are a welcome addition to the mountain-homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.17;Maintaining such a distant colony will be impractical.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# You gain a new barony in your demesne
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.18;The mayor of the new colony in [target_mining_target.GetName] has met with your liason. The title paperwork is ready - it is time for your investment to become a new part of your demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.18;May it grow to be an important part of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Failure. What do?
EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.37;The mining venture to [target_mining_target.GetName] was a total failure. Either you or one of the other supposed professionals involved in this venture made some serious mistakes which cost the realm. Many dwarven lives, and your entire investment, have been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.37;May the Maker keep their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.37;The guilds will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.37;Vengeance must be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# non-dwarf responses

EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.20;Word has reached your ears of an adventurous band of dwarves from the realm of [From.Realm.GetName] travelling in search of a new mine-home within the borders of [target_mining_target.GetName]. Their expedition leader seeks your leave to cross your marches in order to settle some barren hill far from any [Root.Religion.GetName] settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.20;May they find what they seek, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.20;Intriguing... perhaps we can make a business arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.20;They do not have my leave and I intend to stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# melkorish response

EVTDESCMEP_dwarves.21;Word has reached your ears of an adventurous band of dwarves from the realm of [From.Realm.GetName] who have walled themselves in a barren hill somewhere in the remote areas of [target_mining_target.GetName].  There they craft items of untold power and value and dig up from the earth what is rightfully yours...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_A.21;They can keep what I do not need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_B.21;We shall see how long they last against my vile force of darkness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTMEP_dwarves_C.21;These greedy creatures would perhaps accept a bribe to join our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
