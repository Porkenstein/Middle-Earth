# The first battle is over, many of your kin have been slain.  You must decide what to do for your realm's protection
EVTTITthingol.1;The Aftermath;;;;;;x
EVTDESCthingol.1_WIN;Thanks to the valor of many, the First Battle of Beleriand has ended.  Morgoth's legions have been routed, his arm pushed back from Amon Ereb to the Iron Mountains, if not his eyes.  This victory is not complete, however.  While the Dark Lord's orcs were no match for the brave warriors of the Moriquendi, many of your kin were slain.  Doriath cannot lose its precious sons, all too few in number already, defending its own borders, let alone the rest of the world.  What should be done to protect your people?  Should we leave the rest of Beleriand to its fate, or risk Doriath itself?;;;;;;x
EVTDESCthingol.1_LOSS;The First Battle of Beleriand has ended, and the day is lost.  The Hill of Ereb is now a stronghold of the Enemy in the South, whence he will surely drive his forces further into Beleriand.  Your warriors have been routed, and many are slain.  The sons of Doriath, however, were not the only to suffer this loss - the Laiquendi, the Eglath, and your Naugrim allies in the Ered Luin have suffered and will continue to suffer from this crushing defeat in the years to come.  What should be done to protect your people from the swords of Melkor?  Should we leave the rest of Beleriand to its fate, or risk Doriath itself?;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthingol.1;Melian, we must withdraw Doriath from these wars.  It is the only way.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPthingol.1;You relinquish your title as de facto High King and hide all of Doriath from the world.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBthingol.1;[Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName], rally the hosts.  We must risk everything, or all will be in vain.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTOOLTIPthingol.1;You risk Doriath, mobilizing all of Eglador in defense of Beleriand.;;;;;;x

# The girdle is weaved
EVTDESCthingol.2;The Girdle of Melian;;;;;;x
EVTDESCthingol.2;Drawing upon ancient strength within herself and the land, Queen Melian has raised an enchantment around the forests of Neldoreth, Region, and Nivrim, as well as the marches of Umboth Muilin, Esgalduin, and Nan Elmoth.  All lands outside of Doriath, the 'land of the fence', are under the de facto rule of Thingol no longer, as he cannot enforce his Lordship as the High King of Eglador while hidden away from Beleriand.\n\nHenceforth, the enchantment will cause any who enter Doriath without an escort to become lost and consfused, wandering the woods until death by hunger.  While it remains to be seen if this enchantment is still potent against the most powerful of beings, the marauding orc-hordes of Angband at least will be unable to set foot in the realm of Hidden King while it lasts.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthingol.2_THINGOL;My subjects are safe.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthingol.2_OTHERS;Such cowardice!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthingol.2_ELVES;A boon for the Iathrim, yet perhaps for Morgoth as well...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPthingol.2;Doriath is encircled by an impenetrable veil of mystification.;;;;;;x
