# Morgoth feigns truce
EVTTITmaedhros.1;The Emissary;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.1;It has been some time now since you were crowned High King. The situation seems bleak, and many of your host express discontent at camping near Mithrim with the Dark Elves without much assured plan for defeating Morgoth. After one such frustrating meeting with the Noldor, you hear of an Emissary from the North approaching your settlements. This fair agent of Morgoth claims that the Dark Lord wishes to end hostilities, suing for peace in exchange for one of the Silmarils. He knows, apparently, how much you and your brothers long for their return, and considers surrendering one of the three a small price for a prolonged peace in these lands. We need only come to the emissary's party to receive the tribute.\n\nYou know this is a trap, yet The Oath drives you to do something to turn this situation to your advantage...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.1;We shall set a trap of our own.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.1;Perhaps I can demand an audience with Morgoth...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPmaedhros.1;You travel to the meeting with a hidden force.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTOOLTIPmaedhros.1;You travel to the meeting with a hidden knife.;;;;;;x

# Your counter-ambush is foiled, your force is destroyed and you are captured
EVTTITmaedhros.2;The Ambush;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.2;The evening light dims as you approach the emissary and his entourage of armored orcs and trolls. The majority of your host follows unseen from the trees and hills, waiting on your signal to attack. The black-clad, elfish courtier of Angband smiles as you approach, his arms opened in welcome.\n\n"Your royal majesty," He exclaims, "We have with us now a Silmaril granted by the Dark Lord himself in exchange for peace. Lay down your arms, as we have done, and come forward to claim the tribute of the most gracious Lord of Arda.";;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.2;(give the signal);;;;;;x

EVTDESCmaedhros.3;You give the signal, rushing the party with blades in hand. From the trees, your elf-host emerges, felling the emissary and the orcs as you rush to search for signs of the Great Jewel.  Just then, the true guards of the emissary arrive - balrogs, emerging from the earth behind your host. Your host is cut down before your eyes, and before you can react, you are bound and dragged away by orcs. As you felled many of their brethren under guise of truce, the orcs make a point to be very unkind to your battered body.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.3;I should have known this would happen!;;;;;;x

# You are taken to morgoth, in chains.
EVTTITmaedhros.4;The Meeting;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.4;The evening light dims as you approach the emissary and his entourage of armored orcs and trolls. You come with a small honor guard, surrounded by orcs. There's clearly no chance that you or your warriors will attempt to join battle, and yet the black-clad emissary gives you a most suspicious look. The armored troll-guard at his side loom over you as you are brought before the elf-shaped apparition astride a black horse. "I expected some kind of attack, but you come as a supplicant in truth - do you perhaps wish to treat with me in earnest?";;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.4;I will make no deal with a slave of Morgoth. Bring me to your lord.;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmaedhros.5;You are uncertain if the emissary is pleased with your request or not, for he smirks and dismisses your honor guard. "Send your elves back to Mithrim. I will take you to the King of the World."\n\nHe escorts you to Angband, but not before restraining you in chains with the aid of Balrogs.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.5;I should have expected this.;;;;;;x

EVTTITmaedhros.6;The Dark Lord;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.6;You are made to kneel before the Dark Lord in his Nethermost Hall, a twisted cavern of obscene ornamentation filled with demons and monsters. Morgoth taunts you before ordering that his servants hang you atop a cliff of the Thangorodrim by a single wrist, the wind and heat buffeting your body as you are abandoned to the many beasts and hostile elements of the Iron Mountains. While this sounds like a sure death sentence, Morgoth's words fill you with a suspicion that he intends to keep you alive for as long as possible. With dread in your heart, you gaze upon the Silmarils in his iron crown...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.6;I will persevere, and pray for rescue. This monster will not break my mind.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.6;Now is my chance! The Jewels are within my grasp!;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmaedhros.7;Stunned by your boldness, the Dark Lord's courtiers are slow to react to your move at the Silmarils. Slashing at Morgoth's eyes with your hidden knife, you grasp one of the beautiful jewels in his hideous iron crown and thrust the knife between the jewel and the metal.  For one fleeting moment, when all are stunned by your boldness, you can feel the glorious light of the trees return to the world... but then the knife snaps. Melkor tears your grasping hand from its arm, severing your limb as the wolves descend upon you. Your final moments are of agony and horror, yet the Silmarils shine still...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.7;I had to try.;;;;;;x

# You hear the trumpets of Fingolfin, and cry out unheard
EVTDESCmaedhros.8;It has been so long since you last heard a sound other than the howling wind permeate the sky above the Thangorodrim. Today, however, you hear a great Noldorin war horn. Opening your battered eyelids as widely you dare, you behold the unmistakable colors of Fingolfin's banners waving in the wind, at rest before the gates of Angband whence you entered all those years ago. You cry out for help, feebly at first, but soon screaming Fingolfin's name into the wind. Your cries are drowned out utterly, even to your own ears.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.8;I have no tears left to cry!;;;;;;x

# Fingon appears far below the cliff face. You beg him to shoot you.
EVTDESCmaedhros.9;When the host of Fingolfin departed some time (hours? years?) ago, that final flickering hope that you didn't know yet existed was bitterly extinguished. As you open your eyes once more, you look upon the distant form of an elf scaling the mountainside. Revealing himself to you now, your dear friend Fingon looks in horror upon your tormented form. Mouthing the words as you are certain that he cannot hear you, you beg him to end your suffering. Understanding at once, Fingon draws his bow and you close your eyes.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.9;At last, my captivity is at an end.;;;;;;x

# Thorondor brings Fingon to the cliff face. Fingon severs your hand and you fly to safety.
EVTDESCmaedhros.10;When nothing happens after some time, you hesitantly open your eyes once more. Immediately before you is Fingon himself, upon a great Eagle of Manwë. It seems that the Aratar, or at least the kin of Súlimo, do not wish to let you die today.\n\nFingon inspects the ruined hand in the fused iron shackle that binds you to the cliffs, and severs it from your arm with a stoke of his blade. The pain and loss is as nothing right now, but you pass from consciousness as he takes you gently into his arms.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.10;I had no hope that this would happen. What do I do now?;;;;;;x

# You grant the high kingship to Fingolfin, skipping over your brothers (who resent this)
EVTDESCmaedhros.11;Upon your return to your elated vassals, instant praise and exaltation is heaped upon Fingon. His bravery delivered the Noldor from the shameful state of a High King in chains, within view yet unreachable. He has done the impossible neither in the name of glory nor of duty - merely personal friendship. The love between you and Fingon now seems to soften the hard lines that have justifiably formed between your host and that of your friend.\n\nDays after your return, you do not feel recomposed. You suspect that you shall never be whole again, in ways other than simple loss of a hand. Yet you begin to see in your mind's eye a strong purpose - something that could easily animate you to action once more. You no longer care for the politics, glory, or even the Jewels. Morgoth must be stopped at all costs, for he intends to make all of Arda his slave.\n\nYou are offered the crown of High Kingship once more.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.11;I will abdicate to mend the wound with Fingolfin's people.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.11;I will accept the crown and make a gesture of reconciliation.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmaedhros.11;I will demand fealty. The Noldor must be united under my command.;;;;;;x

# Seeing that the tensions between your people, your brother's people, and the host of Fingolfin are not lessening, you decide to relocate.
EVTDESCmaedhros.12;Despite your best efforts and dramatic motions, the peoples of Fingolfin and Feanor have not made their peace. Tensions mount once more as the so-called 'dispossessed' folk begin to claim their right to the kingship. Fear of coming kinstrife thickens the air - something must be done to avert disaster. Conflict among the princes of the Noldor would certainly endanger the containment of Angband.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.12;There is no other way... our people must relocate East.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPmaedhros.12;You send urgent missives to the Lord of Beleriand begging his leave to settle in the East.;;;;;;x

# You ask Thingol for permission to settle in the north lands
# Thingol responds. You and your brothers begin to relocate.
EVTDESCmaedhros.13;My [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName], I have heard your missives on settlement in East Beleriand. Seeing how the Mereth Aderthad has apparently established friendship between our peoples, I will permit you and your kin to dwell in the sparsely peopled lands of Beleriand. But you are not permitted to so much as set foot in Doriath.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.13;He offers us land he does not own? Interesting.;;;;;;x

EVTTITmaedhros.14;The Kingdoms of the Noldor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.14;And so it has been decided that the two hosts of the Noldor must part ways, the host of Fingolfin remaining in Hithlum and the sons of Feanor departing to found new kingdoms in the more sparsely people places of Beleriand.  With them go Turgon, an ambitious lord with dreams of a new Tirion, and the kin of Finarfin, who see the dire need for a fortified frontier against Morgoth's aggression.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.14;Fare thee well, kin.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.14;Assemble the scouts. We depart at once to find a new Realm.;;;;;;x

EVTTITmaedhros.15;The Kingdoms of the Noldor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.15;And so it has been decided that the two hosts of the Noldor must part ways, the folk of Maedhros remaining in Hithlum and the folk of Fingolfin departing to found new kingdoms in the more sparsely people places of Beleriand.  With them go the kin of Finarfin, who see the dire need for a fortified frontier against Morgoth's aggression.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.15;Fare thee well, kin.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.15;Assemble the scouts. We depart at once to find a new Realm.;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmaedhros.16;My [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName], ;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.16;Fine, but they may not enter Doriath.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.16;I do not consent to this. Such insolence!;;;;;;x

EVTTITmaedhros.17;[target_settle_duchy.GetName];;;;;;x
EVTDESCmaedhros.17;You and your scouting parties have arrived in the lands of [target_settle_duchy.Kingdom.GetName], at the site known to the locals as [target_settle_duchy.Capital.GetName]. This is a good, defensible place that you believe could be settled by your people and fortified for the long war with Morgoth. If those fortifications prove effective or unneeded, perhaps these [target_settle_duchy.Capital.GetTerrain] could be the seat of a new Kingdom ruled by you and your descendants.\n\nThe local Dark Elf populace, such as it is, might embrace your protection against the chaos of Morgoth's orc-raids, or rebel against your overlordship. You have received mixed reactions from the local guides and traders that you've come across on your journey.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmaedhros.17;They must accept the new reality. Begin moving in and building up.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmaedhros.17;This place is not hospitable. Let us keep looking...;;;;;;x
