# introduction - the burning of the ships

EVTTITfeanor.2;The Burning of the Ships;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.2;You have disembarked upon the lands of your birthright at last.  The vast ocean of the Belegaer lies at your back, as do Fingolfin, Ingwë, and the remainder of your kin in Eldamar.\n\nThose Ñoldor brave enough to join this quest for vengeance, or those personally loyal to the House of Fëanor, have accompanied you with strength of arms, ready and willing to shed blood for the Oath.  Their first taste of war with the Falmari was a grisly affair, as the Sea-Elves parted with their lives before their ships.  The war to follow will be far worse.\n\nThere can be no turning back now, no temptation for cowardice.  The fair ships bore you well, but their role in this tale is at an end.;;;;;;x

# Feanor meets the first lord of the Sindar

EVTTITfeanor.1;The Feast of Cirith Ninniach;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.1;My Lord Ñoldor, I am called Palancund, prince of Nevrast. It gladdens my heart to see the return of our lost kin, particularily in such dark times.  I invite you and your bannermen to my halls in the fair cleft of Cirith Ninniach, where my brother and I shall host a great feast in your honor.\n\nÊl síla erin lû e-govaned vîn,\nPalancund Nos Malgalad;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.1;A welcome respite!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.1;I will not fraternize with savages.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.1b;You and your vassal lords enter Palancund's dwelling in the rainbow cleft to much fanfare.  Many of your host's kin greet you in their Sindarin tongue with tales of Eglador and beyond, and the Ñoldor in turn tell of the wonders of Eldamar.  The feast, although simple by Valian standards, is sufficient and the wine flows.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.1b;Perhaps these Sindar are not so brutish after all.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.1c;While discussing your quest and the lands nearby, Palancund's eyes light up as you express need for a defensible, cultivable land of encampment.  "The northern shores of Lake Mithrim lie uninhabited, my Lord. It lies in sight of the Ered Engrin, and yet Hithlum is as tranquil and fertile a land as one could imagine.";;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.1c;Mithrim, you say?;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.1c;Fantastic, we will encamp there.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.1d;After the feast, Palancund surprises you by offering fealty to the crown of the Ñoldor. The Dark Lord has returned, he explains, and the kins of Elwë and Finwë must unite against him.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.1d;I can always use more good elves.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.1d;I have no time for such opportunistic subservience.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.1e;As you and your entourage depart, you reflect on the wealth and learnedness of Palancund, realizing that you should revise all of your preconceived notions on the Dark Elves.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.1e;Truly our kin indeed.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.1e;Devious for such simple creatures.;;;;;;x

# Feanor debates the burning of the ships with maedhros, friend of Fingon

EVTDESCfeanor.3;Atanya, you are quite familiar with the friendship between Fingon and myself.  I fear for him now that you have burned the ships, as he and the Ñoldor of his house are implacable.  They will attempt to cross the Helcaraxë, and many will perish.  If my friend pays for your vainglory with his life I may not forgive you.\n\nYour son,\nMaedhros;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.3;The Helcaraxë? Do not be ridiculous.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.3;If the fools wish to die, I will not blame myself.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfeanor.3;I am sorry, my son. I should have taken your counsel.;;;;;;x

# The Battle Under the Stars

EVTTITfeanor.4;Dagor-nuin-Giliath;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4;Your scouts have returned from the east. While it was known to you that the forces of Morgoth were directed to attack the realms of the Sindar, they appear to have turned northward in preference of a more valuable target - you.\n\nThe Dark Lord has sent forth host of orchoth beasts from Angband numbering in the ten thousands, marshalled by demon lords. Apparently the Enemy believes that such a meagre force is adequate to burn your encampment and slay you.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4;I am insulted. Prepare for battle!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4;You drive the eager band forward.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.4;Melkor is a great deceiver.  We must be cautious.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTOOLTIPfeanor.4;You will prepare your defenses and fight on your own terms.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4b;Your wrath has driven the blades of your bannermen true. The orcs were no match for such an assault, and most have broken rank and fled to the mountains.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4b;Forward! To Angband and victory!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4b;The Oath will soon be fulfilled.;;;;;;x
# only available if you lose the proud trait (through a superficially bad response to the words of maedhros)
EVTOPTBfeanor.4b;This was too easy. It must be some kind of trick.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBTOOLTIPfeanor.4b;Your pride has been tempered enough to recognize this baiting.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4c;You have chased the routed orcs to the very gates of Angband, the Annon Daer.  Beyond the great brass edifice sits your rival Melkor, the scourge of all creation.\nEmboldened by wrath and drunk on victory, you drive forward with your personal royal guard.  But even as the gate enters your reach, your guard-captain utters a cry. The balrogs, mighty Demon lords mantled in shadow and flame, have emerged from the earth to surround your companions, cutting your vangard force off from the rest of the Ñoldor.  It seems that you have fallen into Morgoth's trap.;;;;;;x
# 20 piety
EVTOPTAfeanor.4c;Curses! We must fight our way out of here!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4c;You cut your losses and attempt to escape with your lives.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeanor.4c;The only possible route is forward! To the gates!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1TOOLTIPfeanor.4c;being halted by the balrog ambush.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB2TOOLTIPfeanor.4c;fighting your way to the gates - the Silmarils lie within.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4d;The flaming blades and whips of the balrogs have rent apart the shields and armor of your guard, and ultimately yours as well.\nThe Ñoldorin warriors accompanying you fought valliantly in your defense, and in the gap that opened during the fighting your sons forced their way into the fray!  Although you are badly wounded and your finest warriors have suffered many losses, escape is at hand.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4d;My sons!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4d;You are rescued by your faithful kin.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4e;The brace holding the gate is forged of some hellish iron and holds the gates fast. Focusing your inner flame, you swing your fell sword through the thin seam in the crude brass gate.\nThe fell spirit within the metal is no match for yours, and the gates swing open.  The balrogs bellow in rage and surprise, and fresh orcs emerge from the pits to meet you at the gate. Battle is joined, and the creatures fall to your blades.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4e;You underestimate me again, Morgoth!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4e;You fight your way deeper into the realm of Melkor.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4f;At last you and your companions have reached the nethermost hall of Morgoth. The mundane lights of torches and bonfires fall to the dominance of the holy gems - the hallowed Silmarils now resting in the Iron Crown of the Dark Lord. rising from his throne, he extends his hand in a gesture of beckoning.\nThe Balrogs, wolves, trolls, and other nameless horrors of Morgoth's court withdraw as Grond, the hammer of the underworld is brought forth.  The time is now for a final reckoning.  You will leave this room with the Silmarils, or not at all.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4f;For Finwë!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4f;You will cut that crown from his head!;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.4g;Your wounds are too great, and you fall to your knees. The pain of your shattered bones and burned flesh is great, but still nothing when compared to the humiliation. You have failed utterly, despite everything.\n\nBefore the blackness takes you, you see your sons, and feel their hands lifting you from the cold stone away from this bleak pit.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.4g;No, no, leave me, leave... me...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.4g;Your pleading is ignored;;;;;;x

# Feanor's Death at Eithel Sirion

EVTTITfeanor.5;The Passing of Fëanor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.5;As your retreating band marches to safety through the pass of Eithel Sirion, you feebly call for a halt. Your wounds are mortal, and your spirit is departing from your body.\n\nThrice you curse Morgoth, facing Angband. It is in this moment of observation, seeing the very mountains which Melkor raised for his own protection, that you realize the truth of Námo's words.  Despite how far your warriors fought, and despite how near you came to the Silmarils, there was never any real hope of victory.  No elf could ever have brought the Dark Lord to heel, nor could have an army of the Ñoldor in shining plate, armed with fell blades. But nonetheless, the Oath remains.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.5;You must avenge me. Swear this...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.5;Your sons ensure their dedication to your house, and to the Oath.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.5b;Your Hröa and Fëa have divided, and you feel yourself drifting to the halls of Mandos. The wrath burning inside of you is far from quenched, however, and your body begins to burn.  Your sons witness as your form is reduced to ashes, the last tongue of flame dying as your awareness of Middle-Earth draws to a final end.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.5b;My name and deeds live on...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.5b;Fëanor Nos Finwë departs from Middle-Earth.;;;;;;x

# Feanor's death from his sons' perspective

EVTTITfeanor.9;The Passing of Fëanor;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.9;As your retreating band marches to safety through the pass of Eithel Sirion, your father feebly calls for a halt. His wounds are mortal, he says, and his spirit is departing from his body.  With the last of his strength, he turns to the North and raises his head, an undiminished hatred burning in his eyes.\n\nThrice he curses Morgoth, facing Angband and the encircling mountains raised by Morgoth for its protection.  After a pause, he returns his ashen face to you and your brothers.  'Swear that you will fulfill the Oath, that you will fight the forces of Morgoth, that you will avenge me...';;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.9;We swear it, father.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.9;You and your brothers ensure your dedication to your house, and to the Oath.;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeanor.9b;Fëanor's Hröa and Fëa divide as he draws his final breath. The wrath burning inside of him is far from quenched, however, and his body begins to burn.  You witness as your father's form is reduced to ashes, consumed by the incendiary power of his own spirit.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeanor.9b;His name and deeds live on...;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATOOLTIPfeanor.9b;Fëanor Nos Finwë departs from Middle-Earth.;;;;;;x
