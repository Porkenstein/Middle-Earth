EVTDESC39100;A decree has been issued confirming the formation of a new military order in Eithel Sirion - the Knights of the Crown. The Knights, the finest Noldorin warriors of the High King's inner circle, now act independently from the Noldorin nobility and serve to defend all of the [Root.Religion.GetName] people of Beleriand. Loyal [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers may call on their support in wars against orcs and dwarves, but they will not fight their own kin under any circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
