LOADING_TIP_0;A king is he who can hold his own, or else his title is in vain. Thingol does but grant us lands where his power does not run.\n\nMaedhros Russandol;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_1;Tears unnumbered ye shall shed, and the Valar will fence Valinor against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over the mountains.\n\nThe Doom of Mandos;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_2;Their Oath shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very treasures that they have sworn to pursue.\n\nThe Doom of Mandos;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_3;See, half-brother! This is sharper than thy tongue.  Try but once more to usurp my place and the love of my father, and maybe it will rid the Noldor of one who seeks to be the master of thralls.\n\nFëanor Nos Finwë;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_4;Last of all is set the name of Melkor, He who arises in Might.  But that name he has forfeited, and the Noldor, who among the Elves suffered most from his malice, will not utter it, and they name him Morgoth, the Dark Enemy of the World.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_5;Then he began a long and secret labour, and he summoned all his lore, and his power, and his subtle skill, and at the end of all he made the Silmarils.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_6;Love not too well the work of thy hands and the devices of thy heart, and remember that the true hope of the Noldor lieth in the West, and cometh from the Sea.\n\nUlmo, to Turgon;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_7;For so sworn good or evil an oath may not be broken and it shall pursue oathkeeper and oathbreaker to the world's end.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_8;These folk are hewers of trees and hunters of beasts, therefore we are their unfriends, and if they will not depart we shall afflict them in all ways that we can.\n\nThe Laegrim, to Finrod Felagund;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_9;...it is sung that the axe smoked in the black blood of the troll-guard of Gothmog until it withered, and each time that he slew Húrin cried 'Aure entuluva! Day shall come again!' Seventy times he uttered that cry, but they took him at last alive...\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_10;Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_11;Of the fate of Ungoliant no tale tells. Yet some have said that she ended long ago, when in her uttermost famine she devoured herself at last.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_12;Lúthien stood upon the bridge, and declared her power: and the spell was loosed that bound stone to stone, and the gates were thrown down, and the walls opened, and the pits laid bare.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_13;The lies that Melkor, the mighty and accursed, Morgoth Bauglir, the Power of Terror and of Hate, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men are a seed that does not die and cannot be destroyed...\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_14;To him that is pitiless the deeds of pity are ever strange and beyond comprehension.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_15;And thus it came to pass that the Silmarils found their long homes: one in the airs of heaven, and one in the fires of the heart of the world, and one in the deep waters.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_16;In this Music the World was begun, for Iluvatar made visible the song of the Ainur, and they beheld it as a light in the darkness.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_17;But he that sows lies in the end shall not lack of a harvest, and soon he may rest from toil indeed, while others reap and sow in his stead.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_18;Thus it was in Gondolin, and amid all the bliss of that realm, while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_19;What I have left behind I count now no loss. Needless baggage on the road it has proved. Let those that cursed my name, curse me still, and whine their way back to the cages of the Valar! Let the ships burn!\n\nFëanor Nos Finwë;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_20;Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?\n\nTúrin Turambar;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_21;If it has passed from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin, that was of old the fate of Arda Marred.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_22;'Half-brother in blood, full brother in heart will I be. Thou shalt lead and I will follow. May no new grief divide us.' 'I hear thee,' said Feanor. 'So be it.' But they did not know the meaning that their words would bear.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_23;...and Elves and Men lifted their voices in wonder and joy. For unsummoned and unlooked for Turgon had opened the leaguer of Gondolin, and was come with an army ten thousand strong, with bright mail and long swords and spears like a forest.\n\nThe Children of Húrin;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_24;A warlike race of old were all the Naugrim, and they would fight fiercely against whomsoever aggrieved them: servants of Melkor, or Eldar, or Avari, or wild beasts, or not seldom their own kin, Dwarves of other mansions and lordships.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_25;Sauron was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves. His dominion was torment.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_26;Thus fell the High King of the Noldor, and they beat him into the dust with their maces, and his banner, blue and silver, they trod into the mire of his blood.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_27;In Beleriand King Thingol upon his throne was as the lords of the Maiar, whose power is at rest, whose joy is as an air that they breathe in all their days, whose thought flows in a tide untroubled from the heights to the deeps.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_28;By the swords of the Noldor alone are your sunless woods defended. Your freedom to wander there wild you owe to my kin and but for them long since you would have laboured in thraldom in the pits of Angband.\n\nTurgon, to Eöl the Dark Elf;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_29;You must choose, Beren, between these two: to relinquish the quest and your oath and seek a life of wandering upon the face of the earth, or to hold to your word and challenge the power of darkness upon its throne. But on either road I shall go with you, and our doom shall be alike. \n\nLúthien Tinúviel;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_30;\nMelkor hated the Sea, for he could not subdue it.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X

LOADING_TIP_33;On the House of Fëanor the wrath of the Valar lieth from the West unto the uttermost East, and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also.\n\nThe Doom of Mandos;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_34;To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well, and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever...\n\nThe Doom of Mandos;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_35;Then when Fingon heard afar the great trumpet of Turgon his brother, the shadow passed and his heart was uplifted, and he shouted aloud: ‘Utúlie’'n aurë! Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatári, utúlie’'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!’\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_36;It is said by the Eldar that in water there lives yet the echo of the Music of the Ainur more than in any substance that is in this Earth, and many of the Children of Ilúvatar hearken still unsated to the voices of the Sea, and yet know not for what they listen.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_37;...for it seems to the Elves that Men resemble Melkor most of all the Ainur, although he has ever feared and hated them, even those that served him.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_38;Aforetime it was held among the Elves in Middle-earth that dying the Dwarves returned to the earth and the stone of which they were made, yet that is not their own belief. For they say that Aulë the Maker, whom they call Mahal, cares for them, and gathers them to Mandos in halls set apart.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_39;In the mountains the Eagles shall house, and hear the voices of those who call upon us. But in the forest shall walk the Shepherds of the Trees.\n\nManwë, to Yavanna;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_40;\nSeldom were the hands and mind of Fëanor at rest.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_41;The wedding of his father was not pleasing to Fëanor, and he had no great love for Indis, nor for Fingolfin and Finarfin, her sons.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_42;...for sorrow and the strife in the house of Finwë is graven in the memory of the Noldorin Elves.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_43;But Ulmo was not deceived, and Tulkas clenched his hands whenever he saw Melkor his foe go by, for if Tulkas is slow to wrath he is slow also to forget.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_44;As three great Jewels they were in form. But not until the End, when Fëanor shall return who perished ere the Sun was made, and sits now in the Halls of Awaiting and comes no more among his kin, not until the Sun passes and the Moon falls, shall it be known of what substance they were made.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_45;Thus with lies and evil whisperings and false counsel Melkor kindled the hearts of the Noldor to strife, and of their quarrels came at length the end of the high days of Valinor and the evening of its ancient glory.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_46;Thus the lies of Melkor were made true in seeming, though Fëanor by his own deeds had brought this thing to pass, and the bitterness that Melkor had sown endured, and lived still long afterwards between the sons of Fingolfin and Fëanor.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_47;Far to the north befell the strife of Morgoth and Ungoliant, but the great cry of Morgoth echoed through Beleriand, and all its people shrank for fear, for though they knew not what it foreboded, they heard then the herald of death.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_48;Here once was light, that the Valar begrudged to Middle-earth, but now dark levels all.  Shall we mourn here deedless for ever, a shadow folk, mist-hanging, dropping vain tears in the thankless sea?  Or shall we return to our home?\n\nFëanor Nos Finwë;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_49;But as for our white ships: those you gave us not. ...Therefore we will neither give them nor sell them for any league or friendship.  For I say to you, Fëanor sone of Finwë, these are to us as are the gems of the Noldor: the work of our hearts, whose like we shall not make again.\n\nOlwë, King of the Teleri;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_50;Ye have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death's shadow.\n\nThe Doom of Mandos;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_51;In Cuivienen sweet ran the waters under unclouded stars, and wide lands lay about, where a free people might we walk.  There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them.  Come away!  Let the cowards keep this city!\n\nFëanor Nos Finwë;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_52;They are a fair folk and wonderful, and they have a power over the hearts of Men. And yet I think sometimes that it might have been better if we had never met them, but had walked in lowlier ways.\n\nSador, to Túrin, on the Eldar;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_53;Go now, lord, while time is! For you are the last of the House of Fingolfin, and in you lives the last hope of the Eldar. While Gondolin stands Morgoth shall still know fear in his heart.\n\nHúrin Thalion, to Turgon;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_54;And most of all Morgoth feared Turgon, for of old in Valinor his eye had lighted on him, and whenever he drew near a dark shadow had fallen on his spirit, foreboding that in some time that yet lay hidden in doom, from Turgon ruin should come to him.\n\nThe Children of Húrin;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_55;Blind you are, Morgoth Bauglir, and blind shall ever be, seeing only the dark. You know not what rules the hearts of Men, and if you knew you could not give it.\n\nHúrin Thalion, to Morgoth Bauglir;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_56;\nDeath you may yet crave of me as a boon.\n\nMorgoth Bauglir, to Húrin Thalion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_57;Before Arda you were, but others also, and you did not make it. Neither are you the most mighty, for you have spent your strength upon yourself and wasted it in your own emptiness. No more are you now than an escaped thrall of the Valar, and their chain still awaits you.\n\nHúrin Thalion, to Morgoth Bauglir;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_58;I hear that they pick some of the fleet-footed and hunt them with hounds. They have learned quicker from the Orcs than we learnt from the Fair Folk.\n\nSador, to Túrin, on the Easterlings;;;;;;;X

LOADING_TIP_69;Behind the circle of the mountains the people of Turgon grew and throve, and they put forth their skill in labour unceasing, so that Gondolin upon Amon Gwareth became fair indeed and fit to compare even with Elven Tirion beyond the sea.\n\nQuenta Silmarillion;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_70;Yet of old have I heard whispers and sayings said in secret amid the weariness of thraldom, concerning a city where Noldoli might be free could they find the hidden way thereto, and we twain may without a doubt find the road to the City of Stone, where is that freedom of the Gondothlim.\n\nVoronwë, to Tuor;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_71;Welcome, O Man of the Land of Shadows. Lo! thy coming was set in our books of wisdom, and it has been written that there would come to pass many great things in the homes of the Gondothlim whenso thou faredst hither.\n\nTurgon to Tuor;;;;;;;X

LOADING_TIP_74;Now he had bid often with the king for the hand of Idril, yet Turgon finding her very loth had as often said nay, for him seemed Meglin’s suit was caused as much by the desire of standing in high power beside the royal throne as by love of that most fair maid.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_75;"Even should victory be thine upon the plain thy city will be sacked and the Balrogs get hence with a measureless booty” and Turgon groaned, for Meglin had known his great love for the wealth and loveliness of that burg\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_76;Tuor gives a shout so great that the Orcs hear it afar and waver at the sound of it. Like a crash of tempest the guard of the Wing were amid the men of the Mole, and these were stricken asunder.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin;;;;;;;X

Come ye of the Hammer of Wrath and we will smite them for their evil.\n\nRog, Lord of the House of the Hammer of Wrath;;;;;;;X
LOADING_TIP_79;’Tis said that Ecthelion’s folk there slew more of the goblins than fell ever in all the battles of the Eldalië with that race, and that his name is a terror among them to this latest day, and a warcry to the Eldar.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin;;;;;;;X
