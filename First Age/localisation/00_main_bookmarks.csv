BM_RETURN_OF_THE_NOLDOR;The Return of the Noldor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_RETURN_OF_THE_NOLDOR_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Gwirith 1497, the Years of the Trees.  Millennia of peace known to Middle-Earth have ended forever. The Great Enemy, The Dark Lord Melkor Morgoth Bauglir, has returned to Angband from his imprisonment in Aman, and is breeding a host of evil creatures in Dor-Daedeloth, the land of darkness. His eventual goal can only be the usurping of Eru's creation with his own, and the destruction of all of the Children of Ilúvatar. Rumors whisper of his crown bearing three great jewels that shine with an unearthly light. Further rumors whisper still of a great host of elves from beyond the sea, the Noldor, whose mighty lord seeks retribution for the jewels' theft, the murder of his father, and the destruction of the Trees of Valinor themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
BM_SIEGE_OF_ANGBAND;The Siege of Angband;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SIEGE_OF_ANGBAND_DESC;Middle-Earth, 14 Ivanneth 60, the First Age of the Sun.  The Noldor have returned, and their realms stand tall above all others in Middle-Earth, save for that of Morgoth. The Dark Lord of Angband has made war upon the people of Beleriand and defeated the folk of Feanor, denying them fulfillment of their oath. At the first rising of the Sun, however, a new force arrived from the West from across the Helcaraxë - the host of Fingolfin. Rather than be left behind in Valinor, Fingolfin's people made the dangerous journey across the Grinding Ice into the Great Lands to support and confront their kin in the host of Feanor, although they found themselves taking the lead in the war as Feanor had fallen. With Fingolfin as the new High King and the lords of the Noldor fragmented across the North, a great siege has begun to set a watch on the gates of Angband and prevent Morgoth from marching on Beleriand again in force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_COMING_OF_THE_EDAIN;The Coming of Men;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_COMING_OF_THE_EDAIN_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Narwain 376, the First Age of the Sun. Men, the secondborn people of Ilúvatar's creation, have awakened and journeyed to Beleriand. Mysterious Forodwaith settle the northern lands, hosts of Easterlings converge on Lothlann, and the houses of the Edain have settled in the plains of Estolad. The Edain, close friends now of the Eldar and allies in their war against Morgoth, have established themselves in several chiefdoms across Beleriand. As their dealings with the Eldar grow in scale, many Mannish lords are likely to enter into the service of an elf-lord or even swear fealty to one. The resulting mixed societies might upset some, but could be the sole means by which this storm can be weathered. As the power of the enemy grows, the secondborn must seek greater enlightenment, craft, and strength in turn... or perhaps a new arrangement with a more powerful patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BATTLE_OF_SUDDEN_FLAME;The Sudden Flame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BATTLE_OF_SUDDEN_FLAME_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Hithui 454, the First Age of the Sun. Morgoth will soon put his plan in motion to destroy the Noldor and reclaim his dominion over Arda. As the watch on Angband is reinforced to prevent the hordes of the enemy from emerging from beneath the Iron Mountains, Fingolfin alone grows fearful. For centuries Morgoth has been left to gather his strength in secret, craft new and terrible sorceries, and breed ever greater monsters of war. Soon, the High King predicts, the Dark Lord will somehow overpower the besiegers at the March of Maedhros and threaten the world once more. The Sons of Feanor, in their arrogance, no longer fear the enemy that was defeated at the Dagor Aglareb. They are content in their march-realms, lords over Men and elves, as ever within sight stand the smouldering peaks of the Thangorodrim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ERA_CHAR_NAME_3238;Fëanor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3238;Curufinwë Fëanáro was the creator of the Silmarils and the second High King of the Noldor after his father, Finwë.  After the destruction of the Two Trees in Valinor, their light remained only in the Silmarils, which were stolen away by Morgoth to Angband.  Fëanor, full of pride and wrath, made an oath to Eru with his seven sons to make enemies of any and all who would keep the Silmarils from them.  Upon making this oath, they left for Middle-Earth with the majority of the Noldor people.  The Noldor, in need of transport across the Belegaer, took the ships of the Telerian Sea-Elves of Alqualondë by force of bloodshed.  This kinslaying would prove only to be the first in the long struggle to reclaim the Jewels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3056;Elu Thingol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3056;Elwë Þindicollo was born in the earliest days of the world, when all of the firstborn dwelt in Middle-Earth.  Whilst wandering the forest of Nan Elmoth, Elwë met the Maia Melian, and the two became entranced.  During their time together caught in this spell of love, the Eldar began to leave Middle-Earth, invited by the Valar to Aman after the Chaining of Melkor.  The majority of Elwë's people, however, refused to leave without their leader, and resided in Beleriand under his rule.  In the thousands of years since, Elwë became known as Elu Thingol, and his people as the Sindar. His realm of Eglador was the peak of elvendom in Middle-Earth, and his union with Melian protected it from Morgoth's designs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3167;Denethor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3167;Denethor, son of Lenwë, was a lord of the Nandor, elves which never sought a life over the sea in Valinor.  By the time of Morgoth's return, Denethor's people, the Laegrim, had migrated over the Blue Mountains to found the Kingdom of Lindon.  Long had Denethor, Cirdan, and Thingol been allies, and in Y.T. 1497, they found themselves honoring that alliance as the Dark Lord prepared to unleash a great host of orcs against them from the north. This battle, the First Battle of Beleriand, would decide the fate of all Elves henceforth in Middle-Earth, and prove to be the end of Denethor's unified kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10015;Morgoth Bauglir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10015;Melkor was the first, most powerful being created by Eru.  As the remainder of the Ainur came to be and joined in the Theme of Ilúvatar, Melkor found himself clashing with it.  As other, lesser Ainur joined with Melkor's rebellious creation, the Wars of the Valar began, with Melkor reigning in Middle-Earth and the Valar in Aman.  The ensuing battles shaped the Earth through their cataclysms, culminating in Melkor's imprisonment in Aman.  With his servants awaiting his return in the North of Middle-Earth, he plotted his vengeance and began a campaign of deceit, feigning repentance.  Turning the Noldor against the Valar and stealing the Silmarils, he fled from Aman to reclaim his dominion on Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10025;Gothmog;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10025;Gothmog was originally one of the Ainur whom Melkor corrupted at the beginning of creation, and gained his name with his rank as the Lord of all Balrogs.  Following Melkor into exile in Middle-Earth, he became one of the Dark Lord's most trusted servants, equalled only by Sauron.  When Morgoth returned to the North and rebuilt his ancient fortress of Angband, he made Gothmog its High Captain and Vanguard leader of his armies.  In the following centuries Gothmog would prove his worth by slaying Noldorin High Kings, shattering kingdoms, and fighting the greatest warriors on the Earth at the bidding of his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3065;Nowë Círdan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3065;Nowë Ciryatan, later known as Círdan the Shipwright, was one of the great elf-lords of old.  When his friend Elwë remained behind in Beleriand, he and his kin refused to depart to Valinor and instead built the great havens of the Falas, dwelling on the western shore of the Hitherlands for thousands of years.  While the suppliers of commerce and transportation throughout much of Beleriand, the Falathrim were neither authoritative nor warlike, until war and peril were forced upon them in 4282.  Morgoth's first move upon his return to Middle-Earth was to send forth two great hosts, one attacking East Beleriand and the other attacking the Falas, which would soon find itself hopelessly beleaguered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3129;Fingolfin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3129;Ñolofinwë Aracáno was born in Tirion to Finwë and his second wife, Indis.  After a rivalry with Fëanor which culminated in the burning of the ships at Losgar, Fingolfin found that in order to honor his word he must cross the Helcaraxë, the great Grinding Ice connecting Aman to Middle-Earth.  Morgoth, the Valar, and Fëanor considered this impossible, but Fingolfin defiantly led the greatest host of Noldor in Eä easterward.  While many died, including his wife Anairë, he and most of his host arrived in Lammoth twenty years later, driving back Morgoth's armies even to the Gates of Angband.  With Maedhros's abdication, the burning of the ships was forgiven and Fingolfin became High King in 4314.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3239;Maedhros Russandol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3239;Nelyafinwë Maitimo, the eldest son of Fëanor, followed his father and brothers across the sea to Middle-Earth.  He was captured by Morgoth in a disastrous battle, but was rescued many years later by his old friend Fingon, son of Fingolfin.  As Maedhros regretted the divide between the houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor, he sought a mending by abdicating the throne to Fingolfin in thanks.  While this eased the people of Fingolfin," his brothers named themselves ""dispossessed""", taking up lands in the east of Beleriand.  Maedhros himself, possessed by hatred for Morgoth and haunted by the pain of his imprisonment, took up leadership of the Siege of Angband in a great fortress on the hill of Himring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3151;Angrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3151;Angaráto was the second son of Finarfin, who, like his siblings, departed for Middle-Earth in a host following that of Fingolfin. Aegnor was chosen as a messenger to the court of Thingol representing the exiled High Elves, where his service was met with mockery by Caranthir and condemnation by Thingol. Angered and disillusioned, he and his brother Aegnor left Hithlum to dwell in the North, in the border realms of Dorthonion. Here they and their followers lived solitary lives of military service in vassalge to their brother Finrod upon the eaves of Ard-Galen, holding Dorthonion fast against the armies of Morgoth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3146;Finrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3146;Artafinde Findaráto was the eldest son of Finarfin, who eventually became High King of the Valian Noldor.  Finrod followed the host of Fingolfin, separating with both his father and his beloved Amarië, in order to lead his people to Middle-Earth.  As the realms of the Noldor were established, Finrod alone held the friendship of his kin Thingol, the greatest lord in Beleriand.  This influence would aid him and his sons, Aegnor and Angrod, greatly in the coming centuries, and (as Finrod desired), prevent war between the two elven kindreds.  Holding realms in Dorthonion initially, the Noldor of the house of Finarfin would eventually become protectors of all West Beleriand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3242;Caranthir the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3242;Morifinwë Carnistir was the fourth and most wrathful of the sons of Fëanor.  His harshness and strong independence led him to Thargelion, far from the realms of Doriath and Finrod, where for centuries he aided Maedhros in his wars against Morgoth and held an uneasy yet profitable alliance with the Dwarves of the Ered Luin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3132;Turgon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3132;Turukáno was the second son of Fingolfin and father of Idril Celebrindal. While crossing the Helcaraxë despite being personally opposed to the flight, he lost his beloved wife Elenwë and would never wed again. Upon entering Middle-Earth, the host of Fingolfin ran into conflict with Morgoth, the Sindar, and the sons of Fëanor. To keep his people safe, Turgon built a great city upon the shores of Middle-Earth, Vinyamar, the New Home. This first great stone construction served his people well, until the Lord of Waters Ulmo chose to reveal a new, secret place for Turgon and his folk to dwell. Turgon, known as The Wise, was a great sponsor of scholarship and art, overseeing the greatest works of the First Age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3098;Eöl the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3098;Eöl was once an elf of Doriath, but his ambition and reclusivity led him away from his kin Thingol's home to found a new realm under the dark boughs of Nan Elmoth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3155;Aegnor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3155;Ambaráto Aikanáro, the third son of Finarfin, departed for Middle-Earth with his close friend and elder brother Finrod. Alongside his brother Aegnor, he ruled much of Dorthonion as a vassal to Finrod and served to defend the lands of Beleriand against the orc-raids of Morgoth. Although he was doomed to die in battle against the forces of Angband, his love for the human Andreth was legendary. As there existed a custom among the Eldar that marriages are not to occur during times of war, the long siege of Angband and Andreth's mortality doomed their love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3241;Celegorm the Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3241;Turcafinwë Tyelkormo was the third son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, born in Valinor in the Years of the Trees. He was a skilled huntsman with an affinity to nature, and through his friendship with the Vala Oromë was gifted the great hound Huan. After the flight to Middle-Earth, Celegorm led forces in the war against Morgoth at the Siege of the Falas and  Dagor-nuin-Giliath before setting with his brother Curufin in Himlad, where he aided his brothers and his cousin Finrod in the Siege of Angband. Celegorm fortified the pass of Aglon, dwelling in great halls with his followers to guard the westernmost pass between Lothlann and Beleriand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_3131;Fingon the Valiant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3131;Findekáno was the eldest son of Fingolfin, leader of the largest host of exiles. Fingon was most renowned for his martial skill and close friendship with Maedhros, the eldest son of Fëanor. It was through this friendship that even after the Burning of the Ships, Fingon was able to prevent the two hosts of Noldor from coming to blows. Climbing the Thangorodrim alone, he rescued Maedhros from Morgoth's cruel imprisonment with the aid of the eagle Thorondor. After Maedhros's return and abdication, the High Kingship was given to his uncle Fingolfin. After Fingolfin was slain by Morgoth, the fate of the Noldor would lie finally in the hands of Fingon as the last High King in Hithlum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10016;Sauron Gorthaur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10016;Mairon "the admirable" was a Maia spirit of the folk of Aulë before the corruptions of Melkor. Always seeking greater efficiency and potency in his crafts, he saw in Melkor a means to further his own creative designs. He became the most trusted servant of Melkor, caretaker of Angband and lieutenant in the cataclysmic wars against the Valar before the Chaining of Melkor. Upon Melkor's final return to Middle-Earth at the dawning of the First Age, Gorthaur had become a "dread abomination", shapeshifting master of werewolves, vampires, necromancy and darkest sorcery. Once the siege of Angband by the Sudden Flame, the fortress island of Tol Sirion fell to Gorthaur's forces and became a new stronghold of the Enemy. Tol-in-Guarhoth it was now called, and its master was afterwards known as Sauron.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_10066;Glaurung;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10066;The origins of the Father of Dragons are shrouded in mystery. The Great Worm of Angband was first seen to emerge from the iron hells in the year 260 of the First Age, where he defiled the Ard-Galen and ran amok among the realms of the Noldor. While Morgoth was not pleased with Glaurung's rash attack, it proved a promising indication of the might that the Urulóki of Morgoth would one day wield. Possessing a fell spirit, Glaurung was cunning and farsighted. He wielded mind-bending sorcery and a breath of fire hot enough to reduce cities to ash. As a lieutenant in the coming war on Middle-Earth, he would see his master's cruel designs fulfilled and a realm of his own to rule as Dragon-King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15229;Halmir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15229;Halmir, son of Haldan, was among the most esteemed chieftains of the Halethrim woodmen of Brethil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15132;Bregolas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15132;Bregolas, son of Bregor, was the eldest of the Beodin children of the lord of Ladros and became chieftain upon his father's death. As the third Lord of Ladros, Bregolas ruled over a realm in eastern Dorthonion peopled by the Host of Bëor, the first and most numerous of the Edain to enter Beleriand. While the main Beodin encampment remained in Estolad, the realm of Ladros was settled by Boromir under the invitation of Finrod earlier in the first age. The edain have served alongside the Noldor for many years, and now are on the eve of a great battle that will decide the fate of Arda. If Bregolas is to fall, his brothers Barahir and Bregil will need to help the northernmost of the Edain survive the coming storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15185;Hador Lórindol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15185;Hador "the Goldenhaired" was the founder of the House of Hador, a descendant of the Host of Marach. The Hadorim first entered Hithlum during Hador's service under Fingolfin in 416 of the first age, where he forged a close friendship with the High King. In return for his service, Fingolfin granted Hador's people the land of Dor-lómin to settle and gifted him the mighty dwarven-made Dragon Helm. As a subject people under Eldar rule, the House of Hador thrived as the noblest and strongest of the houses of Edain and would stand alongside their king Fingolfin to face any threat to the Noldor realm. Contesting with jealous Mithrim, Noldor racists, and Spies of Morgoth may prove the true difficulty of Hador's reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15258;Bór the Faithful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15258;Bór was one of the greatest easterling lords of the First Age, one among a few lords of the Swarthy Men who made a pact of alliance with the Noldor. The Easterlings had entered the lands of Beleriand following the Edain after leaving Palisor, in hopes to discover new lands to pillage and settle. While their stay in Middle-Earth was brief and tumultuous in the cold plains of Lothlann, they eventually consolidated into several large hosts that made pacts of alliance with the Eldar. During the League of Maedhros, Ulfang and Bor would fight alongside the firstborn strangers in this new land against the armies of the Black Foe who once visited their ancestors in Palisor as a self-proclaimed god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15268;Ulfang the Black;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15268;The folk of Ulfang entered Beleriand late in the first age, where their associations with elves, Forodwaith, and Edain proved unpredictable. Seeking new lands to settle and pillage, some allied with the firstborn yet others allied in secret with the Enemy. During the Union of Maedhros, Ulfang and Bor formed an alliance with the Noldor, who would depend on them all too much in the coming battle against Morgoth's legions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_4390;Azaghâl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_4390;Azaghâl, king of Belegost, son of Dwálin II, and lord of the Broadbeam people, was one of the greatest warriors of the Khazad to ever live.  Saved by Maedhros while attacked by Orcs on the Dwarf-Road, Azaghâl offer the prince both an alliance and a gift of the Dragon Helm, crested with an image of Glaurung, the Father of Dragons.  During the great battle to come, Azaghâl would meet face-to-face with Glaurung and his offspring, acheiving both legendary victories against Morgoth, and equally legendary defeats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15189;Húrin Thalion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15189;Húrin, son of Galdor, was the Lord of Dor-Lomin to join battle alongside Fingon and the League of Maedhros late in the first age. Raised in his mother's homeland of Brethil with his brother Huor, he visited the hidden city of Gondolin during his youth and developed a keen interest thereafter in the ways of the High Elves. After his father's death in an attempted orkish invasion of Hithlum, Hurin became the Lord of Dor-Lomin and bearer of the Dragon Helm. The fate of his House, his lady Morwen, and his children Turin, Urwen, and Nienor would be decided in a final stand against the forces of Morgoth. His secret knowledge of Gondolin's location would come to draw the unwelcome interest of the Dark Lord himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15225;Haleth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15225;Haleth, daughter of Haldad, accompanied her father's people during their journey into Beleriand. Entering slowly in smaller numbers than the folk of Bëor, the Haladin encamped secretly in the woods of southern Thargelion. After a deadly orc-raid slew Halad, his people were left with no male heir. Taking up the chieftainship, Haleth valliantly led the defense of their encampment against the orkish assult for a week, until the warriors of Caranthir drove off the orcs. Impressed by her courage and skill, Caranthir offered the Haladin fealty and settlement in the lands of Talath Rhúnen, but their fate lay in the west, in greater independence and safety. The house of Haleth was destined to survive, through the slimmest odds, well into the Third Age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15112;Baran;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15112;Baran, son of Bëor the old, was the second lord of the first house of the Edain in Beleriand. The Beodin fled the fields of Palisor when pursued by Men corrupted by the Enemy, crossing the Blue Mountains in 310 of the First Age under the leadership of Balan. There they became the first of the Edain to meet the Eldar when Finrod Felagund greeted them with music and friendship. Although they had dealt with Dwarves and Avari beforhand, it was Thingol and the Noldor who supported them in their hour of need and granted them lands to settle in Estolad. Balan was to enter service with Finrod and aid in driving back the orc-raids of Morgoth as they appeared in the north, thus protecting his own people and serving his firstborn patrons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15174;Malach Aradan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15174;Malach "the noble man", son of Marach, was a renouned elf-friend and ally of Fingolfin. The third house of the Edian, the Maradin, were led by Marach over the Ered Luin into Beleriand a generation earlier, where Thingol and the sons of Feanor granted them leave to settle alongside the Beodin in the empty lands of Estolad. Inspired by the welcoming friendship of many firstborn, his son Malach entered into Fingolfin's service. He and his followers left the plains of Estolad to fight the orc-raids of Morgoth and share in the wisdom of the Eldar, settling first in a Noldorin fortress and later at the foothills of the mountains of shadow. Aradan's service began a tradition of service in Fingolfin's court that would last for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15178;Magor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15178;Magor, son of Malach, was an ambitious Edain lord of the House of Marach. Leading his followers away from both Estolad and his father's court in Hithlum, he and a sizable group of Maradin settled the southern foothills of the Ered Wethrin, among the Sindar of Ivrin near Finrod Felagund's realm of Nargothrond. Although he was kin to many renowned elf-friends, and an ancestor of the famous Hador Lórindol, Magor himself served no elf-lord during his stay. He sought instead to forge his own destiny of greatness for his secondborn people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_NAME_16000;Ulren;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_16000;In the later years of the first age, rival hosts of strange "Swarthy Men" began to emerge from Caranthir's Pass. Bellicose in temperment yet brave and resilient, these newcomers prompted many of the same questions that their predecessors the Edain had when they first appeared in Beleriand. The lands of Lothlann are sparsely peopled, mostly by roaming Forodwaith, and would serve as seemingly suitable homes for these steppe-dwelling Easterlings. It remains to be seen whether these newcomers would prove to be another weapon against the enemy or another pawn of his will to dominate all life on earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
