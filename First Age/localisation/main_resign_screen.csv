DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ surpass the House of Fëanor, the greatest of the Children of Iluvatar. Fëanor was the greatest craftsman in history, creating the Silmarils, jewels containing the light of the Trees of Valinor. After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils by Melkor, Fëanor and his sons vowed that every living thing that would keep the jewels from them would perish by their hands. The Sons of Fëanor were among the most powerful of the Lords of Middle Earth throughout the whole First Age, and were the only ones who would directly oppose Melkor. Routed first in the Dagor Bragollach and then in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, they met their final fates during the subsequent kinslayings of Doriath and Sirion during attempts to find the Silmarils. Only Maglor survived to wander the earth past the First Age, a broken soul. Their sole descendant Celebrimbor crafted the rings of power in the Second Age.;Avec un score de $SCORE$, vous surpassez la Maison de Fëanor, le plus grand des Enfants d'Iluvatar. Fëanor était le plus grand artisan de l'Histoire, et a notamment fabriqué les Silmarils, joyaux qui renfermaient la lumière des Arbres de Valinor. Après la destruction des Deux Arbres et le vol des Silmarils par Melkor, Fëanor et ses fils firent le serment que tout être vivant qui mettrait la main sur ces joyaux périrait de leurs mains. Les Fils de Fëanor furent les Seigneurs les plus puissants de la Terre du Milieu, hormis Melkor, durant tout le Premier Âge, et étaient les seuls à pouvoir tenir tête au Vala.;;;;;x

Fingolfin is one of the few who dared to defy Morgoth in single combat, but died during the fight.;Avec un score de $SCORE$, vous surpassez la Maison de Fingolfin. Fingolfin était le deuxième fils de Finwë, le Haut-Roi des Noldor en Valinor.

Finrod ruled the mighty kingdom of Nargothrond in the First Age, befriending the Edain and vassalizing his kin Aegnor and Angrod in Dorthonion.

Galadriel règnera plus tard sur la forêt de Lothlorien, en compagnie de son époux Celeborn, et possède l'un des Trois Anneaux des Elfes : Nenya. Galadriel sera également la belle-mère d'Elrond, et donc la grand-mère d'Arwen Undomiel.

Many thousands of years later, Thingol ruled a mighty realm from his hidden capital in Menegroth, the Thousand Caves delved for Thingol by the hands of the dwarves.

DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$, you$FAILED$ surpass the house of Olwë. The white-haired Olwë was the younger brother of Elu Thingol, serving together as the lords of the Teleri. After the Teleri were sundered into those of Middle-Earth and those in Aman, Olwë became the king of those in the West, named the Falmari. Crafting great fleets and cities on the isle of Tol Eressëa, his seat of power was at the swan-haven Alqualondë. He resisted Fëanor's theft of the white ships, and his people were thus the victims of the First Kinslaying. Afterwards Olwë refused to aid the Noldor in the war of wrath, but continued to rule in Valinor for millenia afterwards.;;;;;;;
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$, you$FAILED$ surpass the house of Hador.

Húrin's host fought valliantly in the Dagor Bragollach, his son Túrin became an infamous outlaw, lord of Nargothrond, and dragon-slayer, and Túrin's nephew Tuor became a high lord of Gondolin and progenitor of the kings of Númenor.;;;;;;;

DYN13_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$, you$FAILED$ surpass the house of Haldad. The Halethrim were the second host of Edain to enter Beleriand from the East, and were beleaguered from the onset. Their Lord Haldad was slain in Thargelion by orkish raiders, leaving the chiefdom to his daughter Haleth, who led her people in battle across Beleriand to the forest of Brethil. In Brethil she reached an accord with King Thingol of Doriath, and guarded the fords of Brithiach in exchange for the right to settle on the hill of Amon Obel.  For over a century, the Halethrim kept a watch upon the crossings of Brethil until kinstrife and the War of Wrath drove them hence. The folk of Haleth survived the drowning of Beleriand, and their descendants peopled lands in Eriador into the Fourth Age.;;;;;;
DYN14_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$, you$FAILED$ surpass the house of Bór. The folk of Bór were of the Baradhrim easterlings, the swarthy men who migrated westward through Maglor's Gap away from the Battle of Palisor in the middle First Age.

The houses of Bór and Ulfang emerged supreme by the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, when the latter betrayed the elves and sealed the fate of Beleriand. Bór and his folk remained faithful and their descendents continued to serve the house of Fëanor in the following years of darkness. Bór's line was preserved after the destruction of Beleriand, as their people settled in Númenor at the dawning of the Second Age.;;;;;;;
