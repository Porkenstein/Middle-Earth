sacrifice_of_flame_desc;The Servants of the Flame are an Order of superstitious Orcish and Goblin shamans in Moria who believe they could appease the scorn of the Balrog by bringing him cruel sacrifices. A Sacrifice of the Flame usually consists of the slaughtering of a Dwarf prisoner, more rarely a Man or an Elf, and of the sacrifice of the corpse into the flames of Moria. Often, in absence of valuable prisoners,  orcs and goblins are sacrificed, even if it is considered a very poor sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

For now... What do you think?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

That scum was chained, the Order stood in circle, sorrounding him, speaking magical rituals. He was forced to knee to the Altar, then the Master of the Flame cut his throat. His bloody corpse was thrown in the flaming deeps. Let's hope that the Flame will be appeased.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

That was not a valuable sacrifice, let's hope it'll appease Flames' wrath.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
