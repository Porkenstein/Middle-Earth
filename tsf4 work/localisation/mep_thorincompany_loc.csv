EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.1;Thorin Meets Gandalf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.1;You press down the unease in your gut enter the Prancing Pony and sit at one of the back tables. You wait for several hour for your contact to show, only appearing when you've decided to leave. "My name is Gandalf," he tells you. After a short conversation about Erebor, he turns over to you a map and key.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.1;Now all we need is a Burglar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.11;Bilbo Joins the Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.11;While Gandalf rages about the cowardly Hobbit, you and the Company collect your gear and mount up on the ponies. As your company nears the outskirts of this village, you hear "Wait! I'm coming!" from behind you. The little Hobbit races up to your party with an eagerness absent the night before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.11;In the morning, you catch sight of Bullroarer's portrait on the wall and Gandalf's words repeat in your head. In the morning's light, you find your courage and race out after the Company. "What for me!" you shout as you find the Company on the outskirts of Hobbiton.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.11;"Foolish, stubborn Hobbit." You shout at the ether. "Master Wizard, are you joining us?" one of the dwarves calls to you. You nod and throw out your arms as you mount your horse, grumbling under your breath. As the party reaches the Hobbiton outskirts, you hear "I'm coming" being shouted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.11;Give him a Pony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.11;I'm Coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.11;"Good," *a smirk forms*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.111;Bilbo's Trolls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.111;The camp is set when you notice the Hobbit has disappeared and so decide to look for him. As the Company reaches the corral, you hear screams from deeper in the woods. Without a thought, your fellows race for them, where you find the Hobbit has been captured by Trolls. They threaten to kill him unless your party disarms, reluctantly you do so and are captured. As they Trolls argue, the Hobbit pipes up "You can't eat them!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.111;The Company makes camp in a forest at the foot of the Mountains. While one of the Dwarves sees to supper, you decide to explore. When you learn that several ponies are missing, you set off to find them and discover 3 large trolls. You try to sneak by but are discovered and captured, quickly followed by the rest of the Company.As the Trolls start talking about how to eat you, an idea comes to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.111;You return from scouting to find the Company has disappeared from camp. Dread fills your senses so you immediately search them out. You soon find them, ensnared by Trolls with plans to eat them. As you survey the area for a way to save them, you hear Bilbo speak up, "They've got worms in their tubes!" You smirk once again as Dawn begins to break, so you move to the East. As the Trolls grab Bilbo you appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.111;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] help us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.111;You can't eat them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.111;The Dawn take you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.112;Events at Rivendell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.112;You and the Company are incredibly weary when you reach the Elven lands. Before long, you meet with Elrond and are 'escorted' into Rivendell. After much back and forth, Elrond agrees to read the map for you. Afterwhich the Elves throw a feast and offer your Company quarters. But you are eager to continue and so slip away when Dawn's first light peeks over the mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.112;You follow the Company further and further afield, to lands you never dreamed you'd see. "Elves!" you exclaim to yourself when you hear that the Company is going to Rivendell. But as soon as you arrive, aggression flares between the Company and Elves. However, tensions are soon eased and the Company is brought into the city. Once inside, Elrond brings Thorin to an inner sactum and reveals the message on the map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.112;You lead the Company along the River Bruien to the territory of Rivendell, where it isn't long until an Elven Patrol happens upon you. After a tense but terse standoff, you are escorted to Rivendell. There, to your annoyance, Thorin rages on the Elves, but Elrond still agrees to read the map and you learn the Mountain's Riddle. Thorin grows eager to press on with the news and come first light, the Company departs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.112;To the Misty Mountains!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.112;The Elves are incredible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.112;My Thanks, Lord Elrond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.113;Goblin Town;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.113;You urge the company ever onward, up into the Misty Mountains. But the Sun sets before before you can make the summit, leaving the moutains in shadow, so you set camp in a nearby crevasse. As the campfire dies, you begin to hear strange noises. "Awaken!" You shout, but it is too late, innumerable goblins pour into crack and overwhelm you all. They take you before a Giant Goblin, the self-proclaimed Goblin-King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.113;You follow the Company up the mountains which grow very dark before Thorin finally calls for camp. As the viel falls over the range, your mind returns to hearth and home, so you leave the cave to think. While you turn the quest over in your mind, you hear screeching followed by Thorin shouting. As you race back to check on the others, you feel a blow on the back of your head and sense yourself falling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.113;The map in hand, Thorin encourages the Company to make for the Misty Mountains straight away. But when you make camp, distance shrieking begins. As darkness fully shadows the mountain, the shrieking grows close and soon you and the rest are overrun by goblins. You notice Bilbo is absent when they drag you before the Goblin-King and a smirk forms on your face. In the chaos of the Goblins' celebration, you take up your staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.113;There is only one King-Under-the-Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.113;*The World fades to Black*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.113;Take up Arms, FIGHT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.114;Trapped by Orcs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.114;You heed the Wizard and take up your weapons, fighting your way away from the goblins. But more pour in and you are soon forced to flee to the tunnels. Gandalf shouts, "Light!" as you battle through the twisted maze and the Company races for it. Behind you, the echoing goblin shrieks slowly fade, you even happen upon the Hobbit as you exit. But all is not well, a party of Orcs are waiting for you as you make the light and you find the company cut off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.114;You overcome the creature by asking "What have I got in my pocket?" but the creature presses for the Ring, forcing you to flee. As the creature closes, fear overwhelms you and you slip. The Ring flies from your pocket, lands on your finger, and you disappear. Safe from the creature, you make your way through the twisted tunnels and come across the Company being chased by Orcs. You place the Ring in your pocket and follow after them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.114;Your staff erupts in Glorious light as the Dwarves rearm and begin hewing their way through their goblin captures, though more and more pour in forcing you and the others to flee into the tunnels. You see light in the distance, calling it out for the others. As you near it, you happen upon Bilbo, who rejoins the company, and soon you all find yourselves outside. But Thorin shouts, "It's a trap!" as Orcs slowly encircle the Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDmep_fvarmy_events.114;Word arrived from Goblin-town, a party of Dwarves were captured on the mountains and brought to the Goblin-king, one of whom called himself Thorin. You dispatch Orcs and race for Goblin-town to put an end to the long-standing thorn. You arrive just as the Dwarves escape the Goblins and cut off their escape. But a host of Eagles appear and steal your prize from your grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.114;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.114;I'm here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.114;My old friend, I need your help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fvarmy_events.114;Fly, you Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEmep_fvarmy_events.114;I had them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.115;Shape-shifter's Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.115;The Eagles drop you a short distance on the far side the Misty Mountains. But the Company is soon in danger once again as the Orcs discover you and begin to harass you. You race across the plains and light woods for a long time, the orcs closing in all the while. As you finally run out of steam and the Orcs surround you, a great Beast appears and forces their retreat. To your amazement, the beast transforms into a Man and promises the Company safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.115;You are awe-struck as the Eagles take you on soaring through the air. But the amusement soon ends when they drop you a short distance away where the Orcs find you and the Company, chasing your all across the plains. When you can no longer keep moving, they surround you and begin toying with you. But then a fearsome Beast charges in and scares off the Orcs. Then the beast turns amazes you futher by changing form into a man and offering aid to the Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.115;The Eagles answer your call and soon deposit the Company far from the Misty Mountains, but all is not well as the Orcs are soon on your heels. As they start to overwhelm you, Beorn, the Skin-Changer, appears and runs the Orcs off, saving the Company. He then offers to aid you in the quest and escorts the Company to his home for rest and recuperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.115;My thanks, skin-changer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.115;This journey grows ever more incredible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.115;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.116;Outskirts of Mirkwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.116;Now relatively safe from the Orcs, thanks to the Skin-changer, you reach the outskirts of Mirkwood. "I must go!" Gandalf declares after studying a strange symbol near the forest's entrance, then leaves the Company to forge on alone. You steel yourself as you urge the Company into the dark-veiled wood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.116;The Skin-changer sees you safe from the Orcs and to the borderlands of Mirkwood. But as you make your entrance, Gandalf spies a strange symbol and fear shows on his face. Then he races off, warning the Company to stick to the path as you travel through the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.116;Beorn sees the Company safe from the threat of the Orcs and to the borders of the Mirkwood. As you leader the Company in though, you catch sight a the Necromancer's symbol and realize you must see Galadriel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.116;Quickly, we must pass through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.116;The woods have an ill-favored look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.116;I must go. Stay on the path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.117;Events of Mirkwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.117;You lead the Company through the forest, but your head begins to fog and you soon fall from the path. As the Company spreads out you find it again, you lose track of them one by one. Finally you are alone, but before you have time to think on that a large spider snatches you up and entombs you in web. Fear builds in you as you feel nudges and legs tapping the cocoon. But luck finds you and you hear Bilbo calling you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.117;As you make your way through the twisted woods, the Company loses sight of the path. You movement off to the side draws your attention only to find yourself alone when you turn back. You slip on the Ring and stumble through the woods alone until you come upon a nest of large spiders preparing to devour your friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.117;The spiders have grown bolder, breaching ever further into your Realm. Worse still, Orcs have been seen entering the Woodlands without contest, stalking the forest and spreading their corruption. You've had enough and so call upon your people to start patrolling the woods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.117;Get us down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.117;I have to do something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.117;See the forest cleared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.118;Captured by Elves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.118;Freed from the spiders and their webs, you and the Company race for the exit of the Woods. But once again, you find yourself trapped, this time by a party of elves. Treats are exchanged but you soon realize you are outmatched as more elves appear and surrender. They take you back to the Elvenking's Hall. There you refuse to answer Thraundil and so he has you and the Company locked in the dungeons. As the others begin to give up, you realize Bilbo is absent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.118;You cut the web binding the Dwarves and soon join them in fleeing the forest. But you are soon overtaken by a party of Elves, but rather than being captured, you slip on the Ring again. Tailing the captors, you enter the Hall and sneak to the dungeons where you free your friends. Thorin grumbles that you are still trapped, but you have an idea and lead the others to the Wine Room. There, the Company escape to the river in empty wine barrels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.118;Your patrols return with reports of increased incursions by the Spiders and Orcs. "I've ordered the forest cleared!" You bark, so they make obedience and depart. Then another patrol returns, only this one has captured a party of dwarves, the leader of which you recognize as Thorin. However, the stubborn dwarf refuses to reveal his purpose so you have them all locked away in the dungeon. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.118;The Burglar will aid us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.118;Wait for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.118;Perhaps a months will listen your tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.119;Escape from the Elves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.119;Bilbo shhs the Company as he frees you all from the cells. But it quickly dawns on you that you are still trapped, "There's no way to get past the guards." Bilbo hushes you and then motions for the stairs. Moments later he leads you to the wine room, you grow angry when you see the room is devoid an exit. But he promises you there is one and motions for the barrels. After a quick drop, the Company is soon free of the Hall and on the river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.119;You stumble backwards from the mechanism and fall into the river. There, the Company cheers you and helps you into one of the empty barrels. The ride is slow as the gentle waters barely push you along and the Elves begin to close in to recapture you. But the waters soon grow into a raging torrent, dangerous but swift, and carry you and the others far from the Elven lands and Prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.119;You take a walk in the forest to relax and think upon the purpose of the Dwarves' being in the Mirkwood. Then your sight falls upon the Lonely Mountain and you guess it. But as you rush back to the Hall to offer a deal, your guards greet you. "Apologies, it seems the Dwarves have escaped the dungeon." Which sets your blood to boiling and your face to burn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.119;Good work, Master Burglar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.119;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.119;Gather the Elves, we March for Erebor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.12;Stay in Laketown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.12;Free from the Elves and Spiders of the Mirkwood, you and the Company reach the lands of Esgaroth, the last realm between you and Erebor. Within these lands, you meet the people of Laketown, who grow intrigue with the Prophesied return to the Lonely Mountain and Death of Smaug. Then, when you promise the Town to a share of the Mountain's wealth, the cheering townspeople promise whatever aid your quest requires. Rested and reequipped, you head out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.12;Now safe from the Elves, Spiders, and Orcs, the Company sets the barrels loose on the River and you mark the memory of the ride with a slight smile. "Esgaroth and Laketown," Thorin states, divining your question before it's asked. You soon find yourself in the floating village where the Company seeks aid for the quest's finish. Which is generously given after Thorin promises the townsfolk a share of the Mountain's wealth. Then you board the boat to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.12;To your shock, you find a party of Dwarves at the armory. The leader introduces himself as Thorin and they are on a quest for the Lonely Mountain. The populace start speaking of the Prophecy, then Thorin speaks to the crowd, swearing to enrich the people of Laketown by sharing the wealth of the Mountain. The crowd cheers and you find yourself without choice but to aid them. Who knows, they may succeed and you'll have a fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.12;To Erebor and the quest's end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.12;I'm not sure about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.12;Welcome to Laketown, King-Under-the-Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.121;Last Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.121;Rearmed and fresh from your visit to Laketown, you command the Company to march on the Mountain. Most of the day is spent on the climb but you finally make the ledge described on the map. As light begins to fade, you still haven't found the keyhole and the Company begins to grumble. So you call for a return to Laketown and the quest to be put on hold. As you head back down, you hear Bilbo call out, "There's something!" The keyhole is found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.121;You and the Company make the grueling trek up the mountain to the Hidden Doorway. As you arrive on the small ledge, the Company pours over the stone for hours as you all try to decipher the Door's Riddle or otherwise gain entry, but to no avail. As the Company loses hope and begins to leave the Mountain, you notice a flickering of light on the Wall. You follow the flickering light as it traverses the mountain until it reveals the Keyhole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.121;Good work, Master Baggins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.121;Guys, there's something!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.122;Settling Debts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.122;You secure the broken entrance with stone and rubble just as the Armies of Men and Elves arrive. "Pay what is owed!" They cry, but a deal under duress is no deal and so you refuse them. "Begone!" you declare to the envoy as you turn your attentions to the most supreme matter, the Arkenstone is somewhere within this mountain. The Dwarven birthright must be found to truly secure your treasures and cement your rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.122;You found the Arkenstone in the Dragon's horde, but become clear that Thorin has grown mad in the Mountain. So to save him and the rest of your friend, you sneak out of the Hall with the Arkenstone to meet with the besieging Armies. There you great the Elf-King and Leader of the Men of Laketown and hammer out a deal, the Arkenstone as a bargaining chip in exchange for breaking off the siege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.122;You take flight from Dol Guldur, the Necromancer threat, Sauron's threat vanquished for a time. But his forces still have their strength and that strength is aimed at Erebor and the Dwarves. So you urge your steed onward with all haste. As you near the Lonely Mountain, you spy two great armies, an army of Men and one of Elves, in siege of the Mountain. But luckily, the Orcish armies are nowhere to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.122;Bring it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.122;I hope this works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.122;There's still time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.123;End of the War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.123;You rally the Allied armies with your charge, but even this show does little to impact the outcome of the battle as the Orcs receive overwhelming reinforcement. But there is hope, removing the snake's head will destroy the enemy so you and your closest kin head for their camp. A desperate fight follows which sees Fili and Kili cutdown, and you are mortally wounded is the final fight, where victory is gained. As Bilbo kneels beside you, you draw your final breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.123;You determine to carry word to Thorin, promising that you will not be seen by the enemy. You duck into a corner and slip on the Ring then make for Thorin with great speed while dodging various encounters. You reach the Summit in time to see Kili and Fili cut down and Thorin stabbed through the chest. You shout in pain and anger as you race to the fallen. You find the Enemy leader dead and Thorin sprawled on the ice. Kneeling beside a dying Thorin, you hear the screech of the Eagles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.123;You spot an ambush shortly after Thorin reaches the summit where the Enemy Leader is camped. With little choice, you turn to Bilbo to carry the information to Thorin, he promises not to be seen before racing off with the message. In the mean time, you see to the defense, encouraging Men and Elves against the Orcs. Then before long the Attack grows chaotic and the Orcs begin to retreat, you realize the enemy Leader is dead. But your ease is cut short when your find Bilbo with Thorin lifeless in his arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.123;Return to your books and armchair, my Friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.123;The Eagles are coming, they'll make it better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.123;Victory, though a costly one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.2;Knock at the Door;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.2;As you put away your book and prepare to turn in, an unexpected knock draws your attention. You open the door and are greeted by a grimy figure, near your height with a greasy, full beard. He pushes past you, heads to the dining room, and takes a seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.2;Can I help you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.21;An Unexpected Party;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.21;Over the next few hours, several more grubby strangers show up at your door, followed by Gandalf. Despite your numerous demands, they all enter and begin a feast. As the meal winds to an end, Gandalfs turns the discussion to an adventure to Erebor, and your expected part in it. Then one of the Dwarves pulls out a contract and hands it to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.21;You look around and discover you are the last to arrive at Bag-end, so take a seat at the table and enjoy the meal. Once you finish your plate, Gandalf speaks up about the coming quest for Erebor. Your companion hands the contract to the hobbit, but the scaredling hems and haws. Eventually, he flatly refuses to join the company. So, at dawn, you gather your followers and head out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.21;You arrive to find that all of the company, save Thorin, have arrived as directed. Thorin, too, arrives in time and a feast is had. As the meal finishes, you turn the conversation to Erebor and Smaug. Bilbo squirms and fiddles as one of the Dwarves hands him the contract to sign. "INCINERATION?! No. No, no, no! I'm a Baggins!" you hear him say. "Do you forget you are also a Took?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.21;Lacerations... Evisceration... INCINERATION?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.21;I said coming here was a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.21;of the line of Bullroarer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.211;Riddles in the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.211;You find yourself in a damp, damp cavern when you shake off the fog. As you stumble about trying to regain your bearings and divine where you are, you spot something shiny in the muck at your feet. It seems to call to you and you soon find a Ring in your palm. As you stare at it, it begins to whisper to you. But your attention is drawn toward an approaching boat, so you slip the Ring into your pocket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.211;Who's there?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.212;Riddles in the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.212;A gnarled figure appears from the boat and approaches you, "Bless and splashes us, it looks tasty! What is its?" the creature exclaims and you stammer back. You pull your sword and swipe at the creature, "Stay back. I've no interest in games." The creature's expression turns to joy at the mention of games and it jumps around. "Does it like to play? If it loses, we eats it whole. What has roots no one sees, is taller than the trees, up it goes, yet never grows?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.212;The mountain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.212;A kite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.212;Time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fvarmy_events.212;A shadow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.213;Riddles in the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.213;When you answer, the creature snarls, "Your turn..." You think for a moment, "30 white horses on a red hill..." The creature struggles at first then shouts, "Teeth!" you grimace as it bears its own and says, "But we only has 9. Our turn." The creature then skulks around the dimly light cavern before rasping out, "Voiceless it cries, Wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.213;Fire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.213;Frost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.213;Wind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fvarmy_events.213;Rain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.214;Riddles in the Dark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.214;The creature grows angry at your response but waits for your riddle. You quickly come up with one, "...inside a golden treasure is hid." The creature hems and haws trying to figure it out, until finally spouting "Eggses!" The creature then grins at you as it stalks over to you, "We have one. All things this devours.

EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.3;The White Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.3;You sense the Necromancer's Touch on the wood and, so, left the Company at Mirkwood to investigate. Soon after, you receive Lady Galadriel's summons and divert course to meet. As you arrive, you find Sauron and Elrond have joined, the White Council is re-convened. There, you press for the Council to attack Dol Guldur and free the region from Evil. To your surprise, the usually reluctant Saruman agrees to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.3;Let us end this Evil then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.31;Battle of Dol Guldur - 1;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.31;You and the rest of the Council arrive at the Fortress and begin to make your way in. The touch of Evil hangs heavy on this place, weighing your every step. As you pass the ancient gates, a horde of Orcs appears and attacks your Party. But Elrond quickly dispatches the threat and you continue onwards into the Heart of Dol Guldur, from which the Evil emanates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.31;I feel you, Dark Lord, Show yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.32;Battle of Dol Guldur - 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmep_fvarmy_events.32;As the Council enters the inner Keep of the dark Fortress, several ghastly figures appear and bar your way. You recognize them as the Wraiths and they attack before you can cast them down. The Council manages to disperse them, causing the Dark Lord to appear. A duel ensues and the combined power of Council overcomes the Darkness. But as you depart, you see a legion of Orcs pour forth towards Erebor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.32;The Company is in Danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.4;Death of Smaug;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.4;"It is your time, master Burglar," you decree to Bilbo. The rest of the Company offer encouragement to bolster the courage of the waivering Hobbit as he enters the Mountain. The next few hours are quiet, save a few shouts towards Bilbo from the Company. That changes instantly as the Mountain quakes followed by Smaugh bursting out. As the Fiend soars through the air, you turn to the horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.4;You enter the dark caverns as the Company bid and soon come across the Dragon's horde. But fear fills you as the Dragon stirs and you find yourself pursued. Thinking quickly, you disguise your quest in Riddle. The Beast soon sees through them though and breaks out of the Mountain. You race outside to watch as Smaug terrorizes Laketown. You fall to your knees as guilt weighs upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.4;The daunting Dragon is seen flying through the sky, it seems the Dwarves have managed to enter the Lonely Mountain. But the hopes in the Prophecy collapse as the fearsome Fiend turns towards Laketown. As it closes, the town erupts in aweful flame, painting the surroundings in shades of amber and bronze for miles. But one of the Soldiers rallys and a Black Arrow sees the end of Smaug.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.4;Find the Arkenstone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.4;What have we done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.4;A Fine Hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.5;Battle of the Five Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.5;The Master has been dispatched but you have your orders, so you gather all the forces of Dol Guldor to march for the Mountain and the end the Dwarves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.5;"What have I to fear, inside this grand fortress?" You coldly say to the Men and Elves of their threats of Orcs. But soon the Orcs arrive and begin to overwhelm the armies. So you determine to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.5;Your plan has succeeded, the Armies of Men and Elves have called off their assault in order to exchange the Arkenstone for a share of the wealth. But before terms can be set, Orcs arrive and threaten destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDmep_fvarmy_events.5;You make it to Erebor only to find Men and Elves besieging the mountain. When you inform them of the coming Orc attack, the three armies agree to a truce just as the Orcs arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEmep_fvarmy_events.5;You came to receive recompense from the Dwarves. Though they stubbornly refuse to pay, you know the Orc hordes are a far greater threat and so join forces to see it to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFmep_fvarmy_events.5;As instructed, all the Orcs and Wargs of the Misty Mountains have gathered. Soon you will march for the Lonely Mountain and bring swift death to the Dwarves in the name of the Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.5;Forward, to WAR!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.5;My friends, follow me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.5;What are we to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmep_fvarmy_events.5;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEmep_fvarmy_events.5;Elves, to battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFmep_fvarmy_events.5;Death and Ruin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTLmep_fvarmy_events.10;Fly, You Fools! Ending;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAmep_fvarmy_events.10;Gandalf calls upon his friends, the Eagles, and they appear in the nick of time to save the Company. To your surprise the Eagles don't drop you off in safety, but rather take you all the way to Erebor. There, Bilbo sneaks inside, reclaiming the Arkenstone. With heavy aid from the Eagles, even Smaug is killed and you take up the Throne. You are King-under-the-Mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBmep_fvarmy_events.10;You nearly give up hope when the Orcs appear, but it quickly fades when Eagles appear in the sky. They save you and the Company from certain doom then go further, taking everyone to Erebor itself. There, you sneak inside and find the Whitestone as you were bid. Still more, the Eagles are proven instrumental in the Battle with Smaug, smiting the Dragon in the Sky over the Lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCmep_fvarmy_events.10;You ask the Eagles to save you, but as you soar through the air, an idea enters your mind and you ask them to aid your journey. Soon enough the Eagles drop you at Erebor where Bilbo retrieves the Arkenstone, crowning Thorin as King-under-the-Mountain. Then the Battle with Smaug is quickly ended with the help of the Eagles. A grave burden is lifted from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmep_fvarmy_events.10;Huh, well quest complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmep_fvarmy_events.10;Not as bad as I feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmep_fvarmy_events.10;That was too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
