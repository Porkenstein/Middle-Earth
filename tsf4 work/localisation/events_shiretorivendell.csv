###SHIRE TO RIVENDELL
##Frodo decides to stay or leave
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.0;The Shadow of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.0;After being left the One Ring by Bilbo, Gandalf told me that I must leave on a quest to take it to Rivendell with all haste, but I have been putting it off. I am to move discreetly, firstly to Buckland, under the pretence of having sold Bag End and bought a new house at Crickhollow across the Brandywine. \n\nSam has agreed to accompany me and knows about the quest, but still, I am not sure I am ready to go just yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.0;We must go to Buckland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBshiretorivendell.0;I'm not ready for an adventure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo stays and is caught
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.01;A Black Rider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.01;One night after returning from the Green Dragon, you sit dozing by your fireplace. A violent knock at the door stirs you. "Just a moment." Before you know it, the door is blasted aside and a great coldness enters the room. The candles and lanterns fall dark. The fire dies. A great skeletal hand leads the black form towards you... "Baggins...!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.01;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x	
#Remove d_ringbearer from non-ringbearer
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.03;No Longer Ringbearer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.03;Only the holder of the One Ring may keep the Ringbearer title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.03;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#give ring to sauron if nazgul successful
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.04;The Ring is Found;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.04;Your Nazgûl have finally found the ring, and have killed it's previous bearer. They ceremoniously return it to your grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.04;At long last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#give ring to sauron if nazgul successful
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.05;The Ring of Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.05;Your Lord has sent you to search for the One Ring. The creature Gollum has given you the name: Baggins of the Shire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.05;I will find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Aragorn leaves for Bree
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.06;The Ring of Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.06;Your trusted friend Gandalf the Grey has asked you travel to Bree and watch for the arrival of a hobbit, Mr. Baggins, who carries the One Ring and is headed for Rivendell. You had pressing business in the north and were unable to leave sooner, and Gandalf has gone on in his own errand. Once there you will watch the roads for signs of the enemy, keep the hobbits safe, and wait for Gandalf to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.06;I will leave immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBshiretorivendell.06;I don't have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam and Pippin leave Bag End and have a chance to be caught by a Black Rider
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.1;Three is Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.1;You are ready to leave. Pippin and Sam have helped pack all your things and will accompany you to Crickhollow. You plan to meet Merry and Fatty Bolger in Buckland after walking cross country. Only Sam knows about the quest, and you hope Pippin does not find out, although he seems quietly suspicious. \n\nAs you look on Bag End one last time, you overhear a stranger talking to your neighbour the Old Gaffer in harsh tones. Sam's father sounds quite frightened but gives no details of your location away, you can only hope the stranger will not come in your direction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.1;I hope we were quick enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam and Pippin leave Hobbiton
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.11;On the Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.11;The rider moves off, the slow clopping of hooves moving further and further away. With some relief you get Sam and Pippin ready and set off to leave Bag End and Hobbiton, perhaps forever. You remember your Uncle Bilbo's walking song... 'The road goes ever on and on, down to the door where it began...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.11;Hum hum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam and Pippin are killed leaving Hobbiton
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.12;A Black Rider;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.12;To your horror, the black rider approaches. You stand petrified in the middle of the road. The rider towers over you, "Baggins!". Your lips tremble and no words come to you. Suddenly, Pippin comes bounding down from the house, claps you on the back and says, "Baggins? Why here's Mr. Baggins! What's wrong, Frodo?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.12;...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#On the way to Buckland

#Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin reach Crickhollow
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.5;A Conspiracy Unmasked;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.5;You have finally reached Crickhollow, your new home in Buckland. Fatty Bolger and Merry have prepared it for your arrival and tried to make it as homely as possible. After hot baths and a meal you sit down around the fire. Merry and Pippin are understandably suspicious of your moving, and of the Black Riders who have clearly been tracking you. After some prying, you reluctantly admit that you are on a quest to take the One Ring to Rivendell, and not just moving home. You tell you them are sorry for putting them in harms way and you will go on alone, but to your surprise they vow they will come with you! You will all leave tomorrow for Rivendell, but there is debate over which route to take... The Forest is dangerous in and of itself, but the Black Riders may be watching the Road...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.5;The Old Forest will be safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBshiretorivendell.5;The Road is the quickest way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo takes road and is caught...
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.51;The East Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.51;You set off from Crickhollow at dawn and make your way as discreetly as possible through Buckland to the borders on the East Road. After a few close shaves avoiding Merry's neighbours and kinsmen. You take the road East, and walk for a few miles. In the distance you hear a great pounding of horses of hooves. Startled, you look for somewhere to hide, but the road at this point is surrounded by open meadow on both sides. Terrified, you can only watch as the rider approaches ahead of you, and another from behind...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.51;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin travel through the Old Forest
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.6;The Old Forest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.6;Such a dark place, constantly shifting and changing... it is playing with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.6;We must keep going!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin make it to the Withywindle
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.61;The Withywindle River;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.61;Out of the forest at last, a clearing on the bank of the River Withywindle!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.61;We are saved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are lost to the forest
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.62;Lost in the Forest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.62;We cannot get out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.62;So hungry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin fall asleep by the willow
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.7;Old Man Willow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.7;Such a peaceful clearing, the river bubbles and sings peacefully, and the willows lining it stir and whisper in the breeze... you sit on the bank leaning against a willow and fall asleep. Before you know it, Sam is pulling you out of the river, you surely would have drowned without him! You look for Merry and Pippin, but they have been ensnared by the roots of the tree, which they slept upon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.7;Help! Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom saves the day - Frodo
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.71;Tom Bombadil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.71;As you cry for help and almost come to tears over the fate of Merry and Pippin, a jolly man with bright red cheeks, a blue hat and yellow boots skips into the clearing. "I am Tom Bombadil.", he says with a friendly grin. He sings to the tree and it gradually releases its hold on the hobbits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.71;Thank you! Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom saves the day - Tom
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.72;Goldberry's Lillies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.72;One day while out gathering lillies for Goldberry, you stumble across four Hobbits on the banks of the Withywindle. Two have been ensnared by Old Man Willow, and you arrive just in time to save them from his strangling roots.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.72;Careful, little friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom's house 1 - Tom
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.8;In the House of Tom Bombadil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.8;You welcome the Hobbits to your home, they eat heartily and sleep well after a tough journey. They are led by Frodo, the most cautious of the four, the others being called Sam, Meriadoc and Peregrin. You talk at length about their journey and the black riders which have been tracking them. You know about his quest, and ask to see the magic ring you know Frodo bears. He reluctantly places it in your hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.8;Ha! Odd. Have it back Frodo...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBshiretorivendell.8;It should be mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom's house 1 - Frodo
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.83;In the House of Tom Bombadil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.83;Tom Bombadil welcomes you into his home and introduces you to Goldberry, his beautiful blonde maiden. They offer you food and beds for the night, much appreciated after your travels in the wilderness. You are talking one day by the fire when he asks about the Ring, despite never having mentioned it yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.83;Uh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodos dream and Tom's help, they set off - Frodo
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.81;Farewell Tom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.81;He places the Ring back in your hand with a grin and leaves it at that. He tells you which way you must go next, to the North, avoiding the dangerous Barrow Downs and back to the East Road towards Bree. Your ponies are well fed and packed and you set off once again on your quest to Rivendell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.81;Thank you, Tom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodos dream and Tom's help, they set off - Tom
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.84;Farewell Hobbits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.84;Bye guys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.84;Most strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom takes the ring - Tom
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.82;Tom takes the Ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.82;My ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.82;HAHA;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Tom takes the ring - Frodo
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.87;Tom takes the Ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.87;No, don't take my ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.87;Noo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#The Barrows
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.9;Fog on the Barrow Downs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.9;After walking over hills and down valleys heading North, you come across a cold stone where you rest and eat. Waking later you find yourselves walled in by mist and head off in what you think is North. You walk in file with your ponies through the cold mist, past great barrow stones. You push on ahead, eager to get out of this hallowed place. You turn and find you have lost the group. You cry out in panic, but no replies comes. You are truly lost, and the cold grasp of a wight takes you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.9;Sam...?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Trapped in a barrow
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.91;The Barrow Wight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.91;You wake on a cold flag floor, and looking up find yourself underground and quite unable to move. With great effort you pull yourself up and find you are lying alongside your companions. They are clad in loose white robes and gold circlets. Rings adorn their fingers and they are surrounded by piles of gold, weapons and armour. A hoarse whispering rushes down a corridor towards you. Frozen by fear, all you wish to do is flee from this place, no matter if you abandon your friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.91;No! I will save them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBshiretorivendell.91;I cannot face this terror!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Frodo leaves Sam, Merry and Pippin to die
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.92;Escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.92;You take flight and run as fast as you can past the ghoul, bursting out into the crisp night air. You run and run, the sounds of the wight's howling screams seeming right behind you even as you crest the next mound. You run and run, and as the sun rises you collapse in a heap in the thick grass. You have commited the greatest dishonour, leaving your closest friends to die...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.92;What have I done...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.93;Saving the Day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.93;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.94;Daggers of Westernesse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.94;You grab a sword and rushing at the wight, take a mighty swing at its arm. The lights go dark, and you softly sob a call to Tom Bombadil for help. Before you know it, you are out of the cairn and on the cool grass, where Tom hands each of you a dagger of old, big as a sword for a hobbit and agrees to accompany you to Bree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.94;Saved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.95;The Barrow Downs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.95;After leaving the Hobbits to continue their journey alone, you weren't entirely certain they would not need your help again. Sure enough, that evening you hear them singing your summon and rush to their aid. You save them from a wight and present them each a dagger of westernesse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.95;Hobbits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.101;On the Road to Bree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.101;You leave the Barrow Downs with Tom, and ride North with him on your ponies, following the Great East Road in the direction of Bree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.101;I feel safe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.102;On the Road to Bree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.102;You leave the Barrow Downs with the Hobbits, and ride North with them on your pony Fatty Lumpkin, following the Great East Road in the direction of Bree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.102;Ho hum...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.111;In Sight of Bree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.111;With Bree in sight a short ways East, Tom takes his leave and heads home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.111;Nearly there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.112;Black Riders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.112;Not a moment after Tom has disappeared to the East, you see a rider hurtling towards you from the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.112;Oh god, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTNAMEshiretorivendell.121;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCshiretorivendell.121;After a short ride you arrive at the village of Bree, chief village of Bree-land and the greatest melting pot of Big Folk and Little Folk in Middle-Earth. It is comprised of houses of stone built into the West side of the great hill of Bree, surrounded by a half moon of tall hedges with gates in the West and South. After a short talk with Harry, the Gatekeeper, you gain entrance and find yourselves on the streets of the bustling village. \n\nYou quickly find the Inn of the Prancing Pony where the keeper, Barliman Butterbur, offers you dinner and a hobbit room for the night. You only wonder whether Gandalf has arrived yet...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAshiretorivendell.121;Safe at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
