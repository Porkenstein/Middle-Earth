just_feudal_government_desc;Just Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, but is more harmonious than normal Feudalism. Peace between vassals is normal, and unjust revocation of titles is forbidden. Holders of Evil government types can be revoked with no objections from other lords, however, and this government types cannot be used by those corrupted by darkness. Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... If you should become corrupted by darkness, your government form will change to Feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
